2013,8104056,"5 R01 HD056953-05","PROJECT SUMMARY For resource-limited settings, the World Health Organization recommends that HIV infected pregnant women who do not need treatment for their own health receive zidovudine (ZDV) from 28 weeks' gestation, with single dose nevirapine (NVP) at onset of labor and in infants at 48-72 hours of life for the prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. This regimen is safe and reduces the risk of transmission to ?2%, but it is associated with the selection of NVP resistance mutations in mothers and infected children. These mutations have been shown to diminish the efficacy of subsequent NVP based therapies. In industrialized countries, more complex regimens using highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) combinations during pregnancy also achieve very low transmission rates while avoiding the selection of resistance mutations to NVP. The study will compare in a multicenter, phase III, randomized controlled, clinical trial the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of a simple, affordable and potent combination of ZDV + lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) from 28 weeks' gestation versus the regimen currently recommended by WHO in a non breastfeeding population. The specific objectives are to evaluate and compare between the two approaches: (1) the risk of HIV transmission (infant HIV status by DNA-PCR); (2) the incidence of clinically significant adverse events in women and infants, and the CD4 and viral load evolution in women; (3) the incidence of HIV resistance mutations. The pharmacokinetics of LPV/r in Thai pregnant women will also be assessed. If proved to be as efficacious and safe as the current WHO regimen for PMTCT, this regimen will provide an option to maintain a low risk of perinatal transmission and resolve the dilemma posed by NVP resistance mutations for both mothers and infected children, thereby preserving their future treatment options. The study will add a third arm to an NIH funded clinical trial, which evaluates another strategy to resolve the problem of NVP resistance mutations, i.e. ZDV from 28 weeks' gestation and infant only NVP compared to the WHO regimen (R01 HD 052461). This three arm clinical trial will follow 2097 consenting HIV-1 infected pregnant women with CD4 count >250/mm3 and their infants in a network of 43 Thai public hospitals up to 24 months after delivery (n=699 per arm including 5% non evaluable; alpha 5%; power: 80%; delta for non-inferiority testing: 1.5%).","6E"
2013,8209846,"1 R01 AI095041-01A1","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common cause of death among people living with HIV. Diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among HIV-infected patients is challenging, as the most commonly used test, the tuberculin skin test (TST), is out-dated, has poor sensitivity in HIV-infected and BCG vaccinated populations, and is operationally difficult to administer. The World Health Organization currently recommends that in regions where the TST can be implemented to detect LTBI, provision of preventive therapy is recommended only for HIV-infected patients with a positive TST. A new blood assay, Quantiferon TB Gold In-Tube (QGIT) test, has been recently approved by the US FDA for detecting LTBI, however relatively few published studies have evaluated this assay in HIV-infected patients and little information exists about the routine use of QGIT, i.e. test performance under routine clinical care conditions and optimal operationalization of this blood test. We propose a cluster randomized trial (CRT) to compare QGIT performance in HIV-infected persons attending public HIV clinics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil with routine TST, and to determine if QGIT more quickly identifies HIV-infected patients who are latently infected and leads to faster initiation of TB preventive therapy. We will link QGIT testing with routine CD4 monitoring which will eliminate the burden of the routine clinic staff and minimally interfere with routine blood draws. Delays in TST and provision of isoniazid preventive therapy in Rio de Janeiro are extremely long, and risk of TB disease is quite high among HIV-infected patients waiting for a TST, thus a better strategy is needed. The specific aims of the study are 1) to compare the impact of linking QGIT with CD4 blood collection and the current standard of care process of TST in HIV clinics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on operational metrics, 2) to compare cost-effectiveness of implementing QGIT versus standard practice of TST, and 3) to explore attitudinal and operational factors influencing successful implementation of QGIT. Our primary focus on linking QGIT with routine CD4 blood draws is innovative and logical given the parameters of the test. These findings, in addition to conducting a structured process evaluation of the implementation of the intervention and determining the cost effectiveness of QGIT compared to TST will provide the best evidence to date comparing these two tests in an operational setting in a developing country, and guide dissemination and implementation of this strategy throughout Brazil and other regions where TST is ineffective at diagnosing latent infection in HIV- infected patients.","1C"
2013,8217664,"1 C06 OD011900-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC) located on the University of California (UC), Davis campus seeks to obtain federal funding in the amount of $895,800 through the Limited Competition: Extramural Research Facilities Improvement Program (C06) to construct overhead structures on four half-acre field corrals. The CNPRC has 24 half-acre field corrals that provide housing for the rhesus monkey breeding colony. Each of these field corrals houses approximately 150 animals. These animals are a long-term breeding resource and serve as a national resource for infants, juveniles, adults, and aged animals for use in biomedical research by investigators from throughout the United States. Twenty of the existing field cages at the CNPRC already have overhead structures to protect the animals from the heat in the summer and the rain in the winter. The proposed four field corrals were built in 2009 to expand production of animals for AIDS-related research and are in need of overhead structures. This project will construct four free-standing 19' high steel-frame canopy covers (similar to patio structures) over approximately one-quarter of a corresponding half-acre field corral, or 540 square feet. The structure will include steel framing, metal roofing, and concrete footings. The specific aims of the proposed project are to: enhance animal well-being and AIDS investigator access to healthy research animals; provide animals a dry area for eating and shelter from the rain in the winter and shade in the summer; address concerns that the lack of overhead structures could be a potential animal welfare concern; provide veterinary and technical staff a dry area to conduct routine animal health procedures and behavioral health assessments.","7B"
2013,8261790,"1 K22 AI098440-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, more than 33 million individuals are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide. HIV infection results in masive dysfunction of the immune system, particularly in mucosal tissues, which ultimately results in progression to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome and death. During HIV infection, the integrity of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is compromised, which allows microbial products to translocate from the lumen of the GI tract into circulation, which contributes to immune activation. Immune activation is the strongest predictor of disease progression during HIV infection, and is characterized by dysregulation of virtually every arm of the immune system. While many aspects of mucosal immune dysfunction after HIV infection have been described, the precise events which precipitate these events, and the mechanisms that underlie these dysfunctions are still unclear. In order to develop more effective therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring healthy mucosal immune function during HIV infection, a more complete understanding of mucosal immunity during HIV infection is needed. Thus, here we propose to evaluate both the kinetics and mechanisms by which the mucosal immune system is altered during acute Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) infection in rhesus macaques. We hypothesize that loss of essential homeostatic mucosal immune cells is the result of increased proinflammatory cells due to SIV replication in mucosal tissues. We will address this using two approaches- in the first aim, we will evaluate the kinetics by which damage to the GI tract and mucosal immune dysfunction occur during acute SIV infection. We hypothesize that increased inflammation after SIV infections results in loss of homeostatic immune cells, which in turn leads to damage to structural barrier of the GI tract. We will address this by evaluating the frequency and function of multiple mucosal immune cells ex vivo, and evaluating the damage to the tight epithelial barrier of the GI tract, microbial translocation and immune activation in vivo at multipe time points during acute SIV infection. This will allow a better understanding of temporal associations between dysfunctions in mucosal immunity after SIV infection to provide insight into cause and effect of each event. In the second aim, we will expand upon Aim I by determining the mechanisms underlying the mucosal dysfunctions that occur after SIV infection. We hypothesize that increased inflammation in mucosal tissues is the result of proliferation and/or increased homing of proinflammatory cells, and that this results in loss of cells that contribute to mucosal homeostasis due to loss in functionality and/or death. To address this, we will evaluate markers of proliferation, early activation, apoptosis, exhaustion, and homing of these cell subsets. Furthermore, we will use in vitro studies to assess whether we can alter the functions of mucosal immune cells based on our hypothesis that increased proinflammatory molecules after SIV infection abrogates homeostatic immune function in mucosal tissues. Taken together, these proposed studies will provide an in-depth assessment into how and why mucosal immune function is altered after SIV infection, and provide insight into developing novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of HIV infection.","2C"
2013,8263011,"1 R01 MH093257-01A1","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): AIDS stigma has long been recognized as a significant barrier in the worldwide fight against HIV. In India, as well as elsewhere, AIDS stigma  has repeatedly been shown, not only to inflict hardship and suffering on people with HIV, but also to interfere with decisions to seek HIV counseling and testing, limit HIV-infected individuals willingness to disclose their status to others, and to deter infected individuals from seeking and adhering to medical treatment for HIV-related problems. Members of marginalized groups often experience additional stigma, forcing them to hide their lifestyles and making it more difficult to  attend AIDS-related prevention and treatment programs. Although several stigma researchers have called for rigorously evaluated, theory-based stigma reduction interventions, few such programs are in place. Our proposed research aims to fill this gap. This collaborative application builds on findings from our decade-long collaborative research program in South India as well as on research conducted by the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW). Our data show that health professionals often represent a crucial source of AIDS stigma in India, highlighting the need to develop and test interventions in health care settings. ICRW has developed and implemented such an intervention, which has been found acceptable and feasible. A modified version reduced stigma among Indian nursing students in our pilot intervention. The efficacy of this promising intervention is now ready to be formally evaluated in a randomized controlled trial with nursing students and ward attendants; the two types of health care providers who showed the greatest levels of AIDS stigma in our preliminary work. In order for an intervention to have a significant and lasting impact, it also needs to be sustainable, and consider aspects such as staff time constraints. We thus propose to use an innovative delivery model to accomplish these goals: 1. Adapt the ICRW health care provider stigma reduction intervention for partial tablet PC-based delivery, using interactive touch screen methodology and video vignettes tailored to participant job type. 2. Conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention in 24 institutions on a) the endorsement of coercive policies and intentions to discriminate toward HIV+ patients; b) instrumental and symbolic stigma; two factors which have been found to drive the manifestations of stigma in this setting.","5C"
2013,8263507,"1 R21 AI098599-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will assess peer change agent communication effectiveness through mathematical models that utilize change agent attribute and structural position parameters developed through existing digital communication networks. Peer change agent (PCA)-based HIV prevention programs capitalize on the phenomenon of peer influence and how members in social networks communicate with one another. PCA-based interventions are the most frequently used outreach HIV prevention interventions and have been widely implemented both domestically and internationally. Existing PCA-based interventions, however, have yielded disappointing results in international settings. The central postulate of this proposa is that the change agent can often be more important than the message itself. Oftentimes, the messages promoted by public health officials may be of limited interest to others, even to those at increased HIV risk. In fact, when messages are of limited interest, those at increased HIV risk will tend to focus more on who the change agent is. The selection of change agents based in whole or in part upon their structural position as measured by formal social network characterization is one approach to increase potency of peer influence: it has been successful in business organization-based interventions. It has not, however, been empirically tested in the public health realm. By adopting this methodology, this proposal moves beyond traditional peer outreach models. In addition to utilizing the structural network position of PCAs to enhance the diffusion of innovation, our model also parameterizes important attributes of PCAs, which are determined by primary data collection from a large network of men who have sex with men in South India. These PCA attributes include social status features, leadership and communication behavior, tie qualities with members of their network, and physical attributes. Previously we have developed an innovative approach to social network characterization in this setting that allows for augmented network characterization through the use of cell phone communication networks in high- risk men. We have field survey data collection expertise in India and experience with large scale social network data collection and analyses. We also have experience in diffusion of innovation analyses through social networks and utilizing mathematical models for determining diffusion of disease and/or information through networks of men who have sex with men (MSM). Thus we will model condom communication within the network using attributes generated from participant interviews and social network-generated structural positions. Candidate PCAs will be selected using three classes of algorithms: (1) attribute-based; (2) position- based; and (3) combined attribute- and position-based. Flow of condom information in the network will be explored using multiple stochastic models that address missing data and are parameterized using self- and peer-evaluation data. In future work, we will test how novel bio-behavioral prevention interventions, diffuse through a network facilitated by strategically selected peer change agents.","5A"
2013,8269960,"5 R01 DA031678-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is an urgent public health need to develop effective pharmacotherapies for methamphetamine (meth) dependence. Globally, use of amphetamines is more common than heroin and opioids, with an estimated 16 to 51 million users worldwide and 1.3 million users in the U.S. in 2007.1 Use of meth (rapidly metabolized in the bloodstream to amphetamine) is up to 20 times more prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM) than in the general U.S. population, and is a major contributor to the continued HIV epidemic. 2-4 Meth use is independently associated with high-risk sexual behavior and HIV seroconversion.5-7 Effective meth treatments therefore will not only reduce meth use, they may also serve as important HIV prevention interventions by reducing meth-driven sexual risk behavior. The lack of FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for meth dependence has limited treatment to behavioral interventions which may benefit from additional adjunctive pharmacologic treatment.8, 9 Furthermore, many meth users, including MSM, do not seek conventional drug treatment, reinforcing the need to develop new treatment modalities.10 Naltrexone, a 5-opioid receptor antagonist, is a highly promising agent that has shown efficacy in reducing relapse of amphetamine use among amphetamine-dependent, yet currently amphetamine- abstinent heterosexuals.11 We propose to expand upon this promising work to determine whether naltrexone will reduce methamphetamine use among actively using, meth-dependent MSM with high-risk sexual behavior through a double-blinded randomized controlled trial of naltrexone versus placebo. We will focus on MSM because of the disproportionate and intertwining epidemics of meth use and HIV in this population. The primary specific aims of this study are: 1) To determine the efficacy of oral naltrexone versus placebo in reducing meth use among actively-using,  meth-dependent MSM with high-risk sexual behavior, as determined by the proportion of meth-  metabolite positive urines by study arm. 2) To determine the efficacy of oral naltrexone versus placebo in reducing meth-associated sexual risk  behavior as measured by: numbers of male anal sex partners, serodiscordant unprotected anal sex  partners, and numbers of sex partners with whom meth was used, by study arm. 3) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral naltrexone versus placebo, as determined by adverse  clinical event rates by study arm. 4) To determine the acceptability of oral naltrexone versus placebo by evaluating adherence via  medication event monitoring systems (MEMS) caps, urine ss-naltrexol, urine riboflavin, and self-report. We will enroll 100 sexually active, meth-dependent MSM who will be randomized 1:1 to receive naltrexone or placebo for 12 weeks. All participants will receive substance use counseling and HIV risk-reduction counseling.","5A,5D"
2013,8294450,"5 R01 HD061061-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to Request for Applications RFA-HD-08-013,  Gender, Youth and HIV Risk (R01).  The broad, long-term objective of the proposed research is to develop and test the efficacy of a theory-based, culturally and contextually competent, and gender-specific behavioral intervention to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV, among African American young men 18 to 24 years of age. The Specific Aims are focused on testing the intervention's effects on sexual behavior and STD incidence and testing the mediation of effects of the intervention. African American young men have some of the highest rates of STDs among men in the United States. Efforts to reduce their risk of STD have been hampered by the lack of sexual risk-reduction interventions with solid evidence of efficacy and the inability to identify how to reach this population. We propose to test an intervention for this population in barbershops, which may be an excellent setting in which to engage African American young men in risk-reduction education. The design of the study is a cluster randomized controlled trial. We will stratify on key characteristics, barbershops in zip codes of Philadelphia, PA with the highest rates of AIDS and match them in pairs. We will randomly select 24 matched-pairs and within each pair, randomly assign the barbershops to one of two brief structurally similar small-group interventions led by a male barber facilitator: a 3-hour HIV/STD Risk-Reduction Intervention or a 3-hour violence prevention intervention that will serve as the control. We will enroll in the trial 24 men from each barbershop, for a total of 1,152 participants. Social cognitive theory, the theory of reasoned action/planned behavior, and the applicant's preliminary studies with the population will guide the development of the intervention. The primary outcomes are self-reported condom use, multiple sexual partners, unprotected sexual intercourse, and sexual intercourse assessed at baseline and 6- and 12-month follow-up via audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI). Secondary outcomes include STDs based on DNA amplification tests on urine specimens and theoretically relevant variables hypothesized to mediate intervention effects, including intentions, beliefs, and self-efficacy. The proposed research has great public health significance: about one-half the cases of HIV/AIDS worldwide are linked to sexual relations between men and women, but few randomized controlled trials have tested HIV/STD risk-reduction interventions specific to young men who have sex with women. This research will test the efficacy of such an intervention in one of the highest risk populations in the United States.","5A,5B"
2013,8302442,"5 R01 MH085527-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor retention in medical care is one of the primary reasons people die of HIV/AIDS today. Modern HIV treatment has transformed this deadly infection into a treatable chronic condition. There are no proven interventions to better retain people in HIV primary care. Hospitalized patients with HIV infection are at high risk for poor retention in care. A single or dual session intervention is essential for most patients out of care, because any patient who could be recruited into a multi-session intervention could likely be recruited back into primary care. Our team has been researching retention in HIV care for over 7 years. Using the information-motivation-behavioral skills model as a framework, our data indicate that among patients recently diagnosed with HIV infection, access to HIV primary care is affected by critical information gaps regarding the availability of care and treatment, limited motivation related to poor coping strategies and low trust in the healthcare system, and weak behavior skills reflected in low self-efficacy and social support around adherence to HIV care. These factors result in poor ability to navigate the health care system and remain in HIV care. We have developed a structured, theory-based, Patient Mentor Program. The Patient Mentor Program was developed to improve retention into HIV primary care by increasing patient knowledge about HIV and the care system, increasing self-efficacy, and promoting active self-management. In a one- time interaction at the Thomas Street Health Center, volunteer patient mentors greet new patients who are arriving for their intake visit to the clinic, guide them through the intake visit and support them. In our preliminary, quasi-experimental data, 88% of patients who had a patient mentor during that intake visit completed a physician visit within the next 90 days, compared to 78% of patients who did not have a mentor (p<.001). These effects remained significant after adjusting for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, and persisted into the 90-180 day interval after intake. We will test the efficacy of the TSHC patient mentor intervention in a 5-year randomized, controlled trial in 434 socio-economically and racially diverse HIV-infected patients hospitalized at Ben Taub General Hospital. We hypothesize that the intervention will meaningfully increase retention in HIV primary care after discharge compared to an attention control. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To test the efficacy of the patient mentor intervention on retention in HIV primary care after hospital discharge; 2) To test the efficacy of a patient mentor intervention on secondary outcomes that include health services use, health-related quality of life, and clinical outcomes; 3) To determine the mediating factors associated with response to the intervention, and the individual and system facilitators and barriers to retention in HIV primary care. This study addresses one of the most important challenges in HIV care today, i.e., expanding modern HIV treatment to all those in need, and may also impact race-based disparities in the health of people with HIV infection.","5C"
2013,8304396,"5 R01 DA025011-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Club drugs are extensively used by young people with more popularity among gay community (men having sex with men; MSM). It has been established that HIV seroprevalence is higher among methamphetamine users and methamphetamine is known to contribute to HIV-associated dementia (HAD) among HIV-positive individuals. There are also indirect and suggestive indications available that methamphetamine affects the virus replication, prevalence and progression of disease. The prospect of testing proof-of-concept studies regarding the role of methamphetamine in HIV positive humans is untenable because of the variable incubation periods and long time required to address this important issue. Therefore a well-designed study in the macaque model of HIV/AIDS is greatly warranted that will help conclude the effect of methamphetamine abuse on lentivirus pathogenesis, neurological disorder and disease progression in relatively short time. We propose to address these issues in this application. The application proposes to (i) establish the SIV-SHIV/macaque model of chronic methamphetamine exposure and examine whether methamphetamine abuse accelerates the onset of AIDS in macaques, (ii) determine whether chronic methamphetamine exposure affects virus-specific cellular, humoral and mucosal immune responses in SIV- SHIV/macaque model of AIDS, (iii) determine whether METH and SHIV/SIV interaction causes enhanced neuropathological effects on the virus/host interaction in the brain and alterations in dopaminergic systems, and (iv) determine whether virus evolution is different in methamphetamine-exposed macaques compared to that in the control animals.","2B"
2013,8308833,"9 R01 GM111028-06","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) is the causative agent of the AIDS pandemic. In the absence of a vaccine, identification of targets for development of agents directed against the rapidly emerging resistant variants is critical. The virus must be released from infected cells  to spread infection and for this process it exploits cellular proteins. The objective of this projet is to identify key proteins and determine how they facilitate assembly and release. Previous studies established the role of Tsg101 and ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) machinery in trafficking of the viral proteins to budding sites on the plasma membrane. Since this machinery functions to sort and deliver cell surface receptors whose signaling is no longer required to lysosomal or proteasomal compartments in the cell interior for degradation, understanding how the virus circumvents this fate will provide information for formulation of novel anti-viral strategies. Preliminary data derived through proteomic, biochemical and cell biological analyses conducted in the previous funding period indicates that the structural precursor polyprotein, Gag, which is the only viral gene product required for formation and release of virus-like particles, directs the recruitment of calcium signaling machinery for this purpose. We propose to identify the determinants in Gag that are required for recruitment (Specific Aim 1), define the contributions of the recruited cellular proteins (Specific  Aim 2) and characterize their physical association to the viral protein and each other (Specific Aim 3). Chimeric Gag proteins with domains derived from HIV- 1 Gag, whose budding is dependent on the calcium machinery and avian sarcoma virus Gag, whose release is not, will be used to identify the key determinants. This approach will be complemented by mutational analysis of specific residues in the identified domains. Functional contributions of the recruited proteins in model cells (e.g., HeLa), T cells and macrophages will be investigated through siRNA-mediated depletion and replacement studies. Physical associations or proximity will be assessed using bimolecular fluorescence complementation, immunoprecipitation, immuno-electron microscopy and biotinylation assays. Direct interactions will be checked using protein- protein interaction assays. These studies will define the mechanism underlying viral exploitation of the ESCRT cellular machinery and provide new strategies for anti-viral drug development by identifying required cellular proteins and events that are potential targets for pharmaceutical interventions.               PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:      Although HIV-1 is still the cause of the world-wide AIDS pandemic and no vaccine is available, infection is no longer a death sentence thanks to interventions targeted at viral gene products, which are now being used as a  functional cure  approach. Nevertheless, major barriers to a cure persist because drug-resistant variants emerge rapidly. Discovery of new anti-viral targets is thus a continuing and critical priority. A strategy that should permit us to circumvent the lattr problem is development of anti-viral agents that target cellular proteins such as Tsg101 and endocytic machinery factors that play key roles in virus production.","6A"
2013,8318667,"5 R01 HL096453-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple data sources suggest that patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) experience chronic lung inflammation, rapid lung function decline, and an increased risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although newer and more potent antiretroviral treatment (ART) appears to nearly eliminate lung inflammation, ART's effects on the rate of lung function decline and other important clinical outcomes remain unknown. Our proposal is designed to address this knowledge gap, while providing a better understanding of the mechanisms for the rapid lung function decline observed in patients with HIV infection. We will accomplish these general aims through longitudinal measurements of pulmonary function and respiratory health status in a subsample of 1,000 participants enrolled in a large, international, randomized, controlled trial - the Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment (START) trial. START is scheduled to begin in early 2009. The parent trial will enroll 4,000 HIV-1 (subsequently referred to as HIV) infected persons who are na¿ve to antiretroviral treatment, with a CD4+ count >500 cells/mm3. Participants will be randomized to either immediate initiation of potent ART or deferral of ART until the CD4+ count declines to <350 cells/mm3. This permits an appropriately controlled, randomized experimental evaluation of the relative effects of early ART treatment (vs. deferred treatment) on pulmonary status in patients with HIV infection. Much of the infrastructure for the START trial is supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) through a Leadership Group grant award to the International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials (INSIGHT). Our proposal seeks support to include the measurement of pulmonary function and respiratory health status in an ancillary study to START. With the data being collected by the main START protocol and the additional data we propose to collect as part of this application, respiratory parameters will be reliably quantified in HIV-infected patients treated with immediate and deferred ART, with control of multiple confounding factors through randomization. The extensive biological specimen repository, including genetic data and other data collected as part of the main START protocol, will provide opportunities for multiple future investigations of biomarkers, proteomics, and genomics related to the development of COPD in patients infected with HIV. Our study will advance understanding of the pathogenesis and course of rapid lung function decline and subsequent COPD in the presence of HIV infection.","6C"
2013,8318849,"5 R01 HD059005-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NOVEL TECHNIQUES FOR THE DETECTION OF PEDIATRIC TB IN ETHIOPIA ABSTRACT Diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis (TB) in resource-limited settings with high rates of HIV and TB is severely limited by methods that are slow, inefficient, and costly, which leads to increased morbidity and mortality. Our research team has made significant progress in the development of new TB diagnostic tools that demonstrate significant advantages over the gold standard diagnostics in adults. We propose to evaluate the potential of these new tools as well as others for the detection and direct susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in children from 0-5 years of age. This project will be set in Ethiopia, where pediatric TB and HIV co- infection are major problems. We hypothesize that, compared to current standard techniques, the diagnosis of active TB in children and the recovery of Mtb isolates from these children can be done more quickly, efficiently, and cost-effectively using alternative clinical specimens in combination with more rapid diagnostic methods for both confirmation of TB and detection of drug resistance. If our hypothesis is correct, use of these methods will allow clinicians to institute rapid treatment directed specifically against the bacterial isolate from the infected child, improving the speed and outcome of anti-tuberculous therapy. To evaluate the potential utility of these techniques, we propose two studies. In the first study, we will evaluate the testing of various clinical specimens using innovative, inexpensive tests that may greatly facilitate the diagnosis of pediatric TB in developing countries with high rates of TB and HIV co-infection. The second study will include children with confirmed TB (identified in the first study) and healthy age-matched children. We will evaluate three immunologically-based techniques for their sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of TB disease. We believe the results in known TB cases can be extrapolated to assess the potential utility of these tests in the diagnosis of the large population of children with TB who are not able to have disease microbiologically confirmed. NARRATIVE Diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis (TB), particularly among young children and those who are infected with HIV is severely limited by methods that are slow, inefficient, and costly. Our research team has developed new TB diagnostic tools and ways of collecting specimens and we are proposing to evaluate them in young children in Ethiopia where pediatric TB and HIV co infection are major problems. If these methods work well, they could allow clinicians to institute rapid treatment directed specifically against the child's particular infection, improving the speed and outcome of TB therapy.","6D"
2013,8329863,"1 R01 GM111029-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project addresses a major goal to identify HIV-1 antagonists that could inactivate the virus specifically before host cell encounter. Inhibition of he initial entry of HIV-1 into host cells remains a compelling and yet elusive means to prevent infection and spread of the virus. Entry is dependent on the ability of the virus envelope protein spike to interact with specific cell receptors in a multistage process that triggers conformational  rearrangements in Env and consequent fusion of virus and cell membrane to deliver virus contents to the host. A peptide triazole class of entry inhibitors has been identified previously and found to be able to bind to HIV-1 gp120 with nanomolar affinity, to suppress protein ligand interactions of the Env protein at both its CD4 and co-receptor binding sites and to inhibit cell infection by a broad range of virus subtypes. Strikingly, we have found recently that a multivalent form of the peptide triazole KR13 displayed on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) is able to disrupt virus particles in the absence of host cells, causing leakage of the internal protein p24 and exhibiting strong antiviral activity. We hypothesize that the multivalent peptide triazole AuNPs are capitalizing on the intrinsic metastability of the virus Env, and that optimizing such nanoassemblies based on modulating their fundamental properties can help identify HIV-1-specific virucidal agents to use in AIDS treatment and prevention by promoting cell-free virus rupture and inactivation. Based on these findings, the Specific Aims of this proposed project are to (1) determine rules of spatial geometry and surface rigidity of gold nanoparticle - peptide triazole (AuNP-PT) that promote cell-free HIV-1 virolysis; (2) determine mechanistic properties of AuNP-PT induced HIV-1 virolysis and its relationship to the pathogenic process of virus cell infection; (3) establish fundamental stability and cell transport properties of AuNP-KR13 nanoconstructs. Overall, this work will derive principles for designing multivalent Env-targeting NP's to enable virucidal actions that are specific for HIV-1. The NP's will help expand understanding of the extent to which the Env metastability that is critical for pathogenic host cel entry can be hijacked to develop tools for HIV-1 therapeutics and microbicides. The results will provide precedent for how other gp120 inhibitor-NP compositions can be devised for HIV-1 virus inactivation as well as how ligand-specific pathogen rupture can potentially be achieved for other viruses that contain metastable prefusion surface protein complexes.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will establish an innovative, multidisciplinary approach, combining nanoscience engineering and HIV-1 biomolecular strategies, to inactivate HIV-1 virus before cell encounter. This work will help stimulate development of specific virolytic agents for AIDS prevention and treatment.","6A"

The drugs of abuse such as cocaine has also been implicated in HIV-1-associated pathogenesis e.g. HAD, HAND. It has become clear that drugs of abuse, including cocaine can modify both cellular epigenetics and signaling pathways, which ultimately modulate the expression of several cellular genes. Therefore, it would not be surprising if the gene expression of integrated HIV proviruses are also influenced with this type of stimuli. Although, HIV gene expression by cocaine until now is mainly attributed to up regulation of several chemokines, cytokines, signaling pathways and some of viral proteins (e.g. Tat and Env), however, the molecular mechanism such as epigenetic changes by drugs of abuse could explain better the continuous induction of several genes even after removal of drug of abuse, which is normally the case. In order to develop better understanding of the complex interplay between drugs of abuse and HIV replication, it is important to investigate the impact of drugs of abuse on HIV gene expression especially in brain cells, as brain is the target organ for both drugs of abuse and HIV. Cocaine is one of the most widely abused drugs in the United States, which both impair the normal functioning of brain cells and also activate HIV gene expression in central nervous system (CNS). As a result, HIV-infected individuals who abuse cocaine experience more severe and rapid onset of NeuroAIDS than non-abusing individuals.  In this grant we will study the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of HIV gene expression and replication by cocaine in two primary macrophage cells, microglial (from brain) and peripheral macrophage (MDMs from PBMCs). Cocaine is known to modulate expression of several cellular genes via inducing selective chromatin modifications by regulating specific set of enzymes. We will investigate how gene expression of integrated HIV provirus is affected by cocaine induced selective core histones acetylations in primary macrophage cells. These modifications ultimately contribute to more rapid deterioration of immune and nervous system, which is quite prevalent in drug addict HIV patients. Broader Impact: This work is expected to lead towards the discovery of new epigenetic pathways, which could direct towards the new therapeutic strategies to address several adverse disease outcomes due to aberrant proviral gene expression and replication in drug addict HIV patients.","2G"

2013,8330092,"1 R03 DA033904-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Methamphetamine (METH) is an illicit drug commonly used (and abused) by HIV-infected patients. METH exacerbates HIV-related neurological impairments and brain injury. Clinical studies show that HIV and METH have additive effects on neuronal loss and glial activation compared to either HIV or METH insult alone. Recent findings also demonstrate that APOE4 suppress K+ channel activities while METH elicits bursts of action potentials. APOE4, a product of the APOE ?4 allele, is a risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease. The APOE ?4 allele is also implicated in accelerating the progression of HIV Disease. To date, no study has been conducted to investigate how APOE gene polymorphisms affect the nature of CNS injury in the presence of HIV infection and in combination with METH use. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the role of genetic variations and their effects on the brain in the presence f both HIV infection and the drugs commonly abused by these individuals. The objective of this proposed work is to better understand the interactions between APOE protein, HIV-Tat protein and METH in promoting neuronal injury via disruption of electrical and physiological responses. Our overall hypothesis is that differential expression of APOE isoforms will determine the severity of neural damage induced by HIV-Tat (during HIV infection) and by METH by directly influencing electrical activities and consequently affecting intracellular calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis. In Aim 1, we will characterize the DNA methylation patterns of post-mortem brain tissues of HIV+ and HIV + METH individuals who are carriers (?4+) and non-carriers of the APOE ?4 allele (?4-). We will determine how methamphetamine use changes the DNA methylation patterns of the APOE promoter and exon 4 CpG islands in HIV-individuals who are ?4+ and ?4-. In Aim 2, we will examine neuronal responses to Tat and METH in the presence of APOE3 and APOE4 proteins by monitoring neurons' electrical activities (Ca2+, Na+, and K+ currents and resting membrane potentials). To achieve this, we will measure macroscopic Ca2+, Na+, and K+ currents and membrane potentials changes using whole-cell patch clamp recordings (in voltage clamp and current clamp modes). These recordings will be done in different APOE isoform backgrounds with and without METH. The data from this research will form the basis of a future R01-level proposal for this New Investigator applicant who is at the early stage of her research career.","2G"
2013,8330809,"5 R01 MH095659-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Enhancing HIV treatment adherence in South India: The Chetana Study Excellent adherence to antiretroviral therapy is essential to achieve HIV suppression and long term treatment success, especially in settings where antiretroviral treatment options may be limited. To accomplish this, it is vitally important that we develop and test culturally appropriate adherence interventions that target local adherence patterns and barriers and that can be quickly scaled up and sustained by local groups. There is also a need for reliable and valid objective adherence monitoring strategies to supplement self-report, which tends to overestimate true adherence rates. The recently developed  Wisepill , which will be used in this study, has the potential to accomplish this. It uses mobile and wireless technology to monitor adherence in real-time and appears to overcome many of the limitations of other objective measures, such as MEMS caps, pharmacy refill records or unannounced pill counts, which are not always feasible in Resource-Limited Settings (RLS). There are few adherence interventions developed for RLS and none have been shown effective in India. This application addresses this gap, building directly on findings from our ongoing collaborative research program examining ART adherence in Bengaluru, India (R01MH067513). To date, we have identified local patterns of non-adherence that predict both treatment failure and the development of drug resistance. We have also documented barriers to optimal adherence in this setting, including the role of AIDS stigma. Based on this work, we developed and pilot-tested  Chetana , a promising, culturally relevant adherence-enhancing intervention that addresses, in a comprehensive manner, the needs of People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA). This proposed innovative program is grounded in Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), with specific content based on our previous descriptive research and extensive pilot testing. In response to participant feedback, it targets not only medication adherence, but also includes other culturally-relevant topics designed to enhance physical and mental health among PLHA, including yoga/meditation, nutrition, legal services, and assistance accessing local resources. It is administered in both group and individual format, is designed to provide peer support for those who do not have sufficient support from family and friends, is flexible enough to be tailored to individual needs, and, if found to be efficacious, could easily be scaled up and sustained with the help of local NGOs. Preliminary research demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention among sub-optimally adherent PLHA and pilot data suggest that it can help participants reduce adherence barriers, improve adherence and reduce treatment interruptions. We now propose to evaluate the effects of this promising intervention in a Randomized Controlled Trial among 500 sub-optimally adherent patients, comparing it to a time-matched active control condition, consisting of only the non-adherence specific components of the intervention and standard clinic counseling.","5C"
2013,8333674,"1 S10 OD012243-01A1","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular imaging involves the use of noninvasive techniques to demonstrate and assess the extent of abnormal biochemical processes and pathophysiological changes that are the basis of disease. CT and standard MRI cannot provide information on the underlying biochemical and physiological properties of disease processes such as cancer. Quantitative PET/CT using novel tracers is ideally suited to provide a more fundamental understanding of disease biochemistry and assess therapy response as well as providing insights on targeted therapy efficacy and novel tracer development. Whole body correlative anatomic and physiological imaging using selectively developed tracers is a critical ingredient for body PET/CT imaging projects since region-of-interest analysis based on a corresponding CT scan is essential for accurate quantification of tracer pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics necessary to provide a meaningful comparison with tissue and serum-based biomarkers of disease. This proposal requests funds for a dedicated research whole-body state-of-the-art PET/CT scanner suitable for conducting dynamic imaging in human clinical trials and research studies using sophisticated scanning protocols and/or novel or short lived PET radiopharmaceuticals. This will allow quantitative imaging biomarker characterization of disease states in a wide range of pathologies in oncology, neurology, vascular and metabolic disease, transplant science, infectious and inflammatory pulmonary diseases, including HIV/AIDS co-infection. Emphasis is placed on imaging biomarker assessment of early response to therapy. A better understanding of the molecular basis and early physiological changes in the diseases presented in the 10 Major Projects are expected to result in advances in individualized patient management by promoting the design of adaptive therapy trials. Project goals include specific measurements of disease physiology and drug-target effects giving the earliest indicator of disease response to drug. Development of quantitative imaging for early disease detection and therapy assessment is becoming critical to future disease management protocols and spare patients weeks or months of toxicity and ineffective treatment. Currently, the capability of performing research PET/CT scans across all scientific and medical discipline areas at the University of Pittsburgh is greatly hampered because no PET/CT scanner is available for use in or near the PET-Cyclotron Facility or at the Presbyterian Hospital complex. Furthermore, all clinical PET/CT scanners are operating at full clinical capacity, with no dedicated time available for research studies. In addition, this scanner will replace one of the HR+ (PET only scanners) soon to be out of support. Thus this instrument becomes critical to the success of the ongoing PET neuroimaging program. It is clear that a state-of-the-art PET/CT research resource is needed by current and future NIH funded investigators at the University of Pittsburgh to achieve their scientific goals in their respective biomedical fields.","7B"

Solid-state NMR (SSNMR) is an essential tool for understanding the structures and dynamics of proteins that are embedded within biological membranes or that form large aggregates and assemblies. An advantage of SSNMR, over other structural methods, is that it does not require proteins to form crystals or be soluble, and can be conducted on protein assemblies greater than 100 kD in size. The proposed acquisition addresses the expanding needs of multiple researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and their collaborators across multiple universities, as the lack of dedicated high-field SSNMR instrumentation in the greater Pittsburgh area is increasingly limiting their research on multiple biomedical fronts. The new instrument will be housed in the state-of-the art NMR facility in the Department of Structural Biology at the University of Pittsburgh - part of a recently established Department of Structural Biology at the School of Medicine. The instrument will serve the needs of scientists in multiple collaborative networks, including the NIH-supported Pittsburgh Center for HIV Protein Interactions (PCHPI). Its incorporation into a pre-existing and otherwise well-equipped research center will ensure optimal usage of this cutting-edge instrument. The major users of the requested instrument will be at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the University of Delaware, with additional users at Carnegie Mellon University, Bucknell University and elsewhere (12 groups in total). Multiple NIH-funded research projects will benefit from the availability of this dedicated high-field solid-state NMR spectrometer, including studies of proteins and protein assemblies involved in HIV-cellular protein interactions, neurodegenerative disorders, neurotransmitter and hormone receptors, as well as cellular trafficking.  The instrument will be fully outfitted for multidimensional spectroscopy in the solid state, specifically for 3D structure determination and dynamics analysis of uniformly, extensively and selectively isotopically (13C, 15N, 2H, 19F) enriched proteins, peptides, and macromolecular assemblies. The instrument will be equipped with low temperature setup and probes, permitting investigations of protein folding and reaction intermediates as well as comprehensive dynamics studies, at enhanced sensitivity. The probes and the dual receiver capabilities will enable development of novel experiments and data acquisition protocols to facilitate studies of large proteins and protein assemblies. This 750 MHz SSNMR instrument will have an immediate impact on the infrastructure at the University of Pittsburgh and participating institutions as it will enable cutting-edge science, will foster highl collaborative biomedical research, and will support the vibrant research environment in the State of Pennsylvania.","7B"

The system will consist of 128 servers, each using 2x8-core 2.93GHz Intel Sandybridge CPUs. 20 large-memory nodes will each have 512GB of RAM (32GB/core), and 100 compute nodes will each have 128GB of RAM (8GB/core). These 120 nodes will each use two 10Gbps Ethernet ports bonded together for a 20Gbps/node (2.5GB/s) connection to the rest of the system, and each node will have 2.4TB raw high- performance local storage. The total aggregate performance of these local disks is over 36GB/s sustained (>300MB/s per node). The remaining 8 nodes will be used for administration, support for advanced software tools and infrastructure, and user interaction. A central high-performance Lustre parallel file system will provide 1.15PB of usable scratch space and sustain 36GB/s to the 128 clients. An archival system of 4 drives/300 tapes will sustain >1GB/s aggregate (accounting for compression), provide 450TB of raw capacity, store ~4.5 PB of user data, and scale to 5x this size. The system, valued at $4.5 million but quoted at $2 million by HP due to the strategic importance of this partnership, will be housed in a state-of-the  art machine room in the new Jennie Smoly Caruthers Biotechnology Building on the Boulder campus (opening Feb 2012), and connect to the rest of the campus at 40Gbps. The system will be a key enabling technology for key scientific areas where data growth is exponential and current systems on campus are end-of-life, solely dedicated to other purposes, or optimized for other tasks. The major users will use the instrument largely for time-consuming one-time tasks such as parameter optimization for microbiome and genome assembly workflows, building knowledgebases, and performing simulations and database searches that will provide resources that are re-used by much broader user communities (hundreds of collaborators; thousands of end users) who lack supercomputing access. One key innovative aspect of this proposal is configuration of part of the system as an academic cloud, which will allow us to pilot workflows that can later be deployed by diverse users on commercial clouds (e.g. Amazon EC2) and academic clouds (e.g. Magellan and DIAG) once those clouds are upgraded. The system will also build a broad expertise base in high-performance computing in the life sciences through outreach to promising new faculty and trainees on NIH training grants, and collaborations with new users of the Sequencing Core. The proposed instrument will thus have a profound impact on NIH-funded research.","7B"
2013,8334809,"1 S10 OD012312-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent dramatic increases in capacity and reduction of costs for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is generating revolutionary new information for biomedical sciences. New information from NGS is providing new insights into genomic aberrations, factors underlying complex diseases, and uncovering new non-coding RNAs, as well as novel RNA modifications associated with cell function. However, the NGS data require intensive computing even to put the data in usable form; and, modeling and analysis of these data require even more computing. Simply put, without matching computational resources the NGS machines are useless. The University of Pennsylvania has six installed NGS machines with additional four machines planned, which are being used by a large community of NIH-sponsored investigators. As the costs continue to come down the user community will only increase. Processing the raw data from 10 NGS machines require up to 14.4 million CPU hours of computing per year. Existing computational instruments can only meet 20-30% of this demand. The only other possible source, external commercial cloud computing, has significantly higher costs, data security risks, and still require additional infrastructure to store the resultig data. To meet the critical demand of NGS technologies, we propose to purchase and operate a dedicated high-performance computation instrument. The proposed instrument from IBM (IDataPlex/SONAS) will have 1,440 computing cores and an expandable multi-tier storage with a total capacity of 1.9 petabytes. This instrument features efficient power and cooling, which is critical for extremely large scale computing, and a modular storage system that can be fine-tuned for NGS performance and cost-effectively enlarged using a balance of hard drives and tapes. Unlike most other specialized equipment, this high-performance computing instrument for biomedical data will impact the research of hundreds of investigators, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate trainees. The instrument will remove a significant bottleneck to utilizing NGS technology; potentially alleviate more than $1 million of computing costs per year for NIH-sponsored investigators; and make prior institutional and NIH investment more efficient and useful.","7B"

The proposed instrument will support the research programs of 9 NIH funded major users (holding a total of 11 NIH research grants in support of the described projects) as well as 7 significant minor users (holding a total of 7 grants from the NIH and other federal agencies). The group of users includes researchers from SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse University and SUNY ESF, all located in Syracuse, NY as well as researchers from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY and the Hauptman Woodward Institute, Buffalo, NY. Research areas supported by the proposed instrument include, but are not limited to, protein and RNA structure, folding and interactions. The biomolecules studied in the user's laboratories are involved in a variety of processes relevant to human health and disease such as energy transduction, RNA structure and mRNA splicing, development of protein and RNA based biosensors, oncogenesis, neuronal function and neurodegeneration, endocrine and exocrine signaling, regulation of histone gene transcription, and membrane transport. There is currently no 800 MHz instrument near the participating institutions so that researchers with a need for very high field NMR applications have to bring or send samples to one of the national facilities such as NMRFAM in Madison, WI or the Pacific Northwest National Labs in Richland, WA. The relatively long turnaround times as well as the cost for traveling and the difficulties with shipping sensitive samples limit the efficiency of these offsite alternatives, creating an ever-greater need for a local facility with esy access. The instrument for which funding is requested is forefront both regarding sensitivity and spectral resolution, thus allowing the analysis of structure, dynamics and interactions of proteins  and nucleic acids beyond a size range of what is currently possible with the available instrumentation. Funding is also requested for a 5 mm cryogenically cooled probe for ultimate sensitivity allowing the analysis of samples with low abundance or poor solubility. The requested instrument is equipped with four channels for conducting triple resonance experiments with simultaneous decoupling of deuterium for analyzing (partially) deuterated samples. The instrument will be housed in the existing NMR facility at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY ESF), where it will be managed and maintained by the facility manager, Mr. David Kiemle. Mr. Kiemle has managed the SUNY ESF NMR facility for the past 25 years and has extensive experience with NMR analysis of bio macromolecules as well as maintenance and repair of modern NMR spectrometers. Acquisition of an 800 MHz NMR spectrometer will provide the Upstate New York region with a state-of-the-art instrument that will accelerate NIH funded biomedical research in the areas of structural biology and drug design, research areas that are essential if we want to find ways to fight human disease on a molecular level.","7B"

Three-quarters of African adults are in cohabiting unions, where most new infections occur.  One Love  campaigns promote monogamy, but unless both partners in a sexual dyad - whether married or concurrent - have the same infection status, being faithful is not protective. In this application, Couples' Voluntary HIV Counseling and Testing (CVCT) provided to cohabiting couples in Zambian government clinics will be extended to concurrent partners, and the impact of joint testing on incidence of HIV acquired within and outside the union will be measured.  Discordant couples are critical to HIV prevention research: They allow study of virologic, immunologic and immunogenetic correlates of 'contagion' and 'vulnerability' in male-to-female and female-to-male transmission, and testing of biomedical and behavioral interventions in both HIV+ and HIV- partners. Comparison of transmitted viruses in donor and recipient clarify the selection process that a vaccine must overcome.  Comparison of HIV incidence in several East-Central African observational discordant couple cohorts with (3.5/100 PY) and without (10.2/100 PY) CVCT yields an estimated reduction of two-thirds. In counseled discordant couples in Lusaka, Zambia, HIV incidence between spouses is 6/100 PY, and an additional 1.5/100 PY are infected by concurrent partners. Only one small published study of uncounseled Zambian discordant couples is available and reported an incidence of 21/100 PY, thus there is less consensus about the effect size of CVCT in southern Africa. Aim 1 will examine the incidence and origin of infections acquired prior to CVCT using viral genome testing and will quantify the prevention impact of CVCT in discordant couples.  UNAIDS and DHS data indicate that most extramarital contacts are with longstanding steady partners. The potential impact of joint testing with concurrent partners (CPT) on HIV infections acquired outside marriage in both discordant and concordant negative couples has not been explored. A formative evaluation phase will precede development (Aim 2) of a CPT intervention adapted from CVCT procedures developed under RO1 MH 66767. Forty clinics with CVCT services managed by the research team will be randomized to provide CPT (Aim 3). The incidence of new infections acquired outside marriage will be compared in the CVCT only vs. CVCT+CPT clinics.  Despite counseling and free services, only 10% of discordant couples with HIV- male partners request male circumcision (MC). Like CVCT, MC is a locally affordable and proven prevention strategy which must be offered to participants in future trials. Ancillary Aim 4 will investigate obstacles to male circumcision (MC) to optimize adherence with ethical standards in future trials.","5A"

In this merit extension, we will confinue to  identify primate reservoirs of human disease, elucidate mechanisms of pathogen cross-species transmission  and examine why zoonofic infecfions are frequently associated with severe illness. Specifically, we propose:  1. To identify the ape reservoirs of HIV-1 groups O and P. While the origins of H|V-1 groups M and N  have been traced to distinct chimpanzee communities in southern Cameroon, the precursors of HIV-1  groups O and P are still uncertain. This is because SIVcpz/SIVgor strains closely related to these lineages  have not yet been identified. Large numbers of chimpanzees and gorillas in west central Africa have not yet  been screened for SIV. We will thus conduct molecular epidemiological studies in these areas, determining  the prevalence, distribution and genetic diversity of SIVcpz/SIVgor infections. We expect these studies to  identify the geographic and species origins of HIV-1 groups O and P.  2. To determine the natural history of SIVgor infection. We recently identified one area in southwestern  Cameroon that represents a hotspot of SIVgor infection (25% prevalence). Prospective studies of three  gorilla groups at this site identified 29 SIVgor positive individuals, including two who only recently became  infected. We will continue to follow these groups prospectively, tracking both infected and uninfected  individuals, characterizing their viruses, and determining the impact of SIVgor infection on their population  size. This will allow us to determine whether SIVgor, like HIV-1 and SIVcpz, is pathogenic in its natural host.  3. To determine whether wild apes serve as a recurrent source for human infection. The recent  discovery of HIV-1 group P strongly suggests that cross-species transmissions of ape SIVs are still ongoing.  Using newly developed diagnostic assays, we will test humans who live in close proximity to wild apes for  SIV zoonoses, focusing on populations with known exposure to primates. We will also screen humans for  ape Plasmodium parasites, having recently discovered the origin of human P. falciparum in gorillas. The goal  is to determine whether and to what extent wild apes represent a recurrent source of human pathogens.  4. To identify viral determinants of cross-species transmission and human adaptation. Host specific  restriction factors, in particular tetherin, pose major hurdles to SIV cross-species transmission. However, 12  independent HIV-1 and HIV-2 introductions indicate that these hurdles are not insurmountable. We will  continue to evaluate tetherin and other restriction factors as barriers to cross-species transmission and  secondary spread. In particular, we will examine whether the lack of an effective tetherin antagonism  contributed to the inability of the rare groups of HIV-1 and HIV-2 to spread epidemically, and whether the  apparent absence of SIVcpzPfe infections in humans can be explained by a similar mechanism.","1A"

2013,8368115,"5 F30 MH096664-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early initiation of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) for HIV-infected persons has enormous benefits, including decreased morbidity and mortality, and reduced secondary transmission. In South Africa, the high mortality rates seen early in ART programs are often due to advanced disease stage at care initiation. The South African government has prioritized widespread HIV testing since 2010 but this campaign will not improve clinical and preventive outcomes unless HIV-infected persons engage in care in a timely manner.  In sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence of HIV infection is extremely high in adolescent women. Treatment and prevention of HIV in this population is critical to reduce the burden of disease. However, challenges to engagement in care, such as perceived stigma and non-adherence to care and treatment, are likely magnified in HIV-infected adolescents. In adults in South Africa, pre-ART loss to care is as high as 50%, and may be even greater in adolescents.  To improve the link between HIV testing and treatment among young women, modifiable barriers that might preclude accessing of clinical services must be understood. Psychosocial and behavioral factors affect adherence to care and treatment among HIV-infected persons, and may be especially important for adolescents because their psychological, social, and physical contexts are undergoing change. HIV-infected adolescents are at increased risk of mental health illnesses and behavioral disorders, but these factors have not been studied in the context of engagement in care. The objective of this Kirschstein-NRSA individual fellowship (F30) is to assess modifiable psychosocial barriers to engagement in care among HIV- infected adolescent women in rural South Africa.  The proposed study will be a one-year prospective cohort design among newly diagnosed HIV-infected young women incorporated into an ongoing randomized controlled trial, with the following specific aims: 1) To evaluate the relationship between disclosure of HIV infection status and engagement in care over 1 year following diagnosis; 2) To determine the relationship between baseline and incident depression and anxiety disorders and engagement in care; and 3) To determine the relationship between coping responses to newly diagnosed HIV and engagement in care.

2013,8368791,"5 U54 HG003273-10","The BCM Human Genome Sequencing Center (HGSC) has developed a large scale, flexible DNA sequencing resource to solve major problems in human genetics and support clinical care. Technical excellence and innovation has allowed the use of multiple sequence platforms and the adaptation of the best sample resources and appropriate data models to match project requirements. In the first 18 months of the proposed timeline at least 1 petabase of DNA sequence will be generated, and 90% of capacity will be dedicated to cancer and human genetic studies. The remainder will be applied to comparative and metagenomics. All of this is made possible because of the HGSC's integrated high throughput data production pipeline that spans sample procurement and processing, sequence production, informatics, data analysis, and dissemination. The modular nature of this pipeline allows us to meet, or even exceed production expectations while at the same time provides flexibility to serve the diverse (and growing) needs of the genomics and biomedical research community. Overall one-half of the capacity will be dedicated to ongoing and emerging NHGRI programs with the remainder to a series of 11 innovative Center Initiated Projects (CIPs). The CIPs include solving the basis of selected common chronic human diseases, piloting a newborn screen and a national population-based health care model, deeply sampling human genetic diversity, identifying critical somatic mutations in rare and familiar cancers and the role of epigenomics in cancer therapy. For understanding common disease, we will develop future CIPs relevant to emerging priorities in human health such as Alzheimer¿s disease. We will also provide a complete genome analysis of all the laboratory rhesus macaques in the USA, as well as study their microbiome. The virome in health and disease will be characterized and an educational program, based upon personal genome sequences will be delivered. The overall objectives, specific aims, and CIPs embodied in this proposal will transform biology through genomics and lead to a new phase of clinical applications.","2A,2C,4A,6A,6D"

We describe a platform for large- scale sequencing and analysis that extends the incredible potential of next-generation sequencing to transform biomedical research and significantly impact medical practice. Our eight specific aims are intertwined across six major research areas that overall address the NHGRI mission and provide an interdisciplinary approach that is already producing medically relevant results in the areas of cancer genomics, heritable disease, and microbial/metagenomics. Our platform offers a consistently cost-effective approach to sequencing-related research projects and we have established a scalable incoming sample pipeline that can intake and track >40,000 samples per year into a flexible and innovative sequencing pipeline. Equally scalable are our LIMS and analysis pipeline capabilities, having established systems that processed several hundred cancer cases through whole genome sequencing and analysis in the last year alone, along with multiple other project types. We describe a research plan that will further our explorations of human health and disease, in a more comprehensive manner than ever before, and will investigate third-generation sequencing technologies, incorporating their unique attributes and integrating them to our production repertoire. One important aspect of our proposed work includes efforts to begin translating our discoveries and procedures into the clinical setting, effectively setting the stage for genomic diagnosis and personalized medicine. This important transition will be required to bring DNA sequencing to clinical medicine, and our innovative combination of sequencing technology, data analysis, and outstanding clinical collaborators increase the potential for success.

However, the impact of perinatal HIV infection on the critical developmental transition from adolescence to young adulthood is unknown. The proposed study is a competing continuation of our current NIMH funded R01 grant Mental Health and Risk Behavior in HIV+ Youths and Seroreverters (R01MH069133; PI:Mellins), informally known as CASAH-1 (Child & Adolescent Self-Awareness and Health). In CASAH-1, we are in the final year of collecting data from perinatally HIV-infected and perinatally HIV-exposed, but uninfected (seroreverter) youth, as well as their caregivers at baseline (youth ages 9-16 years) and 18-month follow-up (youth ages 11-18 years). Participants were originally recruited from four urban medical centers in NYC. In the proposed project, CASAH-2, we will study the impact of HIV infection on risk and adaptive behaviors as our sample of vulnerable youth approach and transition into young adulthood. We will examine how HIV infection and critical risk and protective factors from our theoretical model of health behavior, Social Action Theory, affect behavioral outcomes that may disrupt or enhance adult functioning. In CASAH-2, youths and caregivers will be re-recruited 1-3 years after their CASAH-1 follow-up interview. They will be interviewed at three additional follow-up time points in CASAH-2, each one year apart for a total of five interviews across CASAH-1 and CASAH-2. The interview assesses Behavioral Health Outcomes (including emotional and behavioral functioning, sexual and drug use behavior, and for infected youth, health care outcomes) as well as risk and protective factors that influence the Behavioral Health Outcomes. In CASAH-2, we will include variables that are particularly relevant for the transition to older adolescence and young adulthood, (e.g. functional milestones related to school/vocation, social relationships, pro-social conduct, and autonomy, and for the HIV+ youth, transition to adult HIV medical care). Few behavioral studies of perinatal HIV infection have focused on psychosocial variables nor have they followed youth into this older age range, and few have adequate comparison groups to identify correlates of risk and adaptive behavior unique to perinatally-infected youth across different developmental stages of adolescents and young adulthood. Such research will have important intervention implications for the US, and also for the much larger pediatric HIV epidemic in low- resource countries where, until recently, limited access to ART has resulted in millions of perinatally infected children.","5B"

The overall goal is a detailed molecular understanding of how neutralizing antibodies, alone  and together, inhibit HIV-1 infection of target cells, and how the antigens that they are directed to modulate  the antibody response by interacting with dendritic cells and B cells.  The work outlined in the proposal will be conducted in Dr. John Moore's laboratory at the Weill Comell  Medical College  We propose three Specific Aims:  Specific Aim 1: Mechanism, stoichiometry and kinetic aspects of HIV-1 neutralization by Abs. In this Aim  we will use new in vitro neutralization assays to dissect how neutralizing antibodies with different  specificities block HIV-1 infection and to quantify the persistent fi-action that survives neutralization. We will  use transmembrane-protein mutants to study how differential exposure of epitopes on the Env-glycoprotein  complex affect the potency and extent of neutralization.  Specific Aim 2: Synergy, cooperativity and breadth of HIV-1 neutralization. We will build on our finding of  Env-glycoprotein heterogeneity as a source of synergy between neutralizing antibodies.

2013,8369331,"5 R01 MH084794-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current treatments have transformed HIV/AIDS from an inevitably fatal disease to one commonly managed as a chronic illness. Many children born with HIV infection, who previously suffered brief life spans, are now surviving into adulthood. This creates the need to understand more fully the obstacles these youth encounter in becoming independent, productive adults. In adults, HIV commonly is associated with impairments in memory and executive functions (such as inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and problem solving), which increase the risk of problems in day-to-day functioning, including medication nonadherence. Studies of memory and executive functions in children and youth with HIV infection are extremely limited, however, and none have included measures of prospective memory (that is, the ability to execute a future intention), which is a particularly robust predictor of daily functioning in adults with HIV. Furthermore, our current understanding of the functional impact of HIV on brain development is limited. The study proposed here would be the first to evaluate the complex interplay between development and HIV infection on memory and executive functions in the context of important functional outcomes in an effort to advance the clinical science of pediatric neuroAIDS. The study will test the hypotheses that: 1) perinatally acquired HIV is associated with deficits in memory and executive functioning; 2) HIV severity and history, including age at greatest disease severity, will be associated with degree of impairment in memory and executive functioning ; 3) developmental change and changes in HIV severity will interact to influence these functions over time; and 4) impairments in memory and executive function contribute to problems in daily functioning (including medication adherence, academic achievement, and adaptive behavior). Using a longitudinal design to examine and control for developmental changes in these functions during adolescence, we will administer measures of verbal and nonverbal retrospective memory, prospective memory, executive functions, and medication adherence to 200 HIV-infected and 75 uninfected youth age 9-18 at two time points, two years apart. Data will be collected at eight sites participating in a large national, longitudinal study of outcomes of perinatal HIV infection, the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study Adolescent Master Protocol, thus allowing us to examine memory and executive functioning in an efficient and cost-effective manner in the larger context of demographic, health-related, cognitive, and behavioral aspects of perinatal HIV infection. This is an important area for investigation because deficits in memory and executive function in youth with HIV could have wide-ranging effects on their acquisition of health and medication management skills, adaptive and academic functioning, behavior, and, ultimately, social and occupational outcome in adulthood. We anticipate this study will not only elucidate developmental neurocognitive aspects of perinatally acquired HIV but will also provide important information and additional tools to target areas of intervention for perinatally HIV-infected youth at risk for poor functional outcomes.","2G"
2013,8369336,"5 F32 DA030268-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    HIV infection is concentrated within prisons and jails. Further, a substantial proportion of incarcerated individuals engage in behaviors that place them at risk for acquisition of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Compared to incarcerated men, women in prisons and jails have higher rates of HIV and STI. While there are data describing HIV risk behaviors in women, few studies focus on incarcerated women, despite their disproportionate burden of HIV and the opportunity incarceration presents to deliver effective prevention interventions. Further, what differentiates imprisoned women who are HIV-infected from those who are uninfected remains unclear and likely extends beyond basic individual demographic and risk behavior categorizations. In particular, difference in interpersonal and contextual factors may place some of these women at greater risk for HIV/STI infection and deserve scrutiny. Additionally, while the prevalence of HIV among incarcerated women is several-fold higher than in the general population, the incidence of HIV infection among women released from prison has not been described. The studies described in this F32 proposal will: a) describe and characterize the behaviors that risk transmission of HIV and other STIs among women entering a state prison in the US South, b) compare HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women entering prison based on individual, interpersonal and contextual factors that may influence vulnerability to HIV, c) estimate the incidence of HIV infection among women released from state prison in NC.

2013,8369345,"4 R37 AI051231-12","Heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 remains the dominant mechanism by which the epidemic is sustained  woridwide. In a majority of transmissions, infection is established by a single genetic variant (the transmitted  founder, TF) from the quasispecies of the transmitting partner (TP), with evidence for reduced Env  glycosylation relative to their chronic counterparts. This concept of selection of virus with traits that favor  transmission has been supported by our recent studies of viruses in the genital tract (GT), but it remains to  be determined what functional properties differentiate TF viruses from their transmitting partner counterparts  We hypothesize that differences in TF virus proteins allow preferential infection of key cell types within the  genital mucosa and through interactions with antigen presenting cells signal the influx of activated CD4 T  cells that can home to gut tissues. In this context, we will generate and characterize full-length single HIV-1  TF virus genomes and genomes amplified from TP bloodand GT in 20 Rwandan and Zambian transmission  pairs; determine their abilities to productively infect vaginal and cervical tissue explants, determine whether  different cells are infected by donor and recipient viruses, investigate their ability to interact with alpha-4,  beta-7 molecules on mucosal T-cells and to induce the release of cytokines in antigen presenting cells  capable of signaling trafficking of relevant activated T-cell populations.  Newly infected partners in couples infected by different strains of HIV-1, are at high risk for superinfection  and subsequent virus recombination. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that susceptibility to  superinfection is related to low levels of neutralizing antibodies immediately prior to superinfection and that  studies of superinfection will inform on the nature of protection required for an effective vaccine. We will  therefore determine the frequency, kinetics and the virologic/immunologic ramifications of HIV superinfection  in this cohort, as well as determine whether specific immunologic defects, such as low levels of protective  antibody contribute to susceptibility to superinfection. The results of these studies will yield novel information  that is critical to the design and testing of globally effective vaccine candidates.","1A,4A"
2013,8369857,"5 R01 AI095178-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is a devastating disease with enormous negative impact on global health. An efficacious vaccine for malaria would be a huge boon for the >40% of humanity with regular exposure to Plasmodium infected mosquitoes. Although a partially protective vaccine (RTS, S) is in phase III trials, subunit vaccines to induce sterilizing liver-stage specific immunity in humans have proven difficult to develop. In contrast, it has been known for over 30 years that radiation attenuated sporozoite (RAS) immunization delivered by mosquito bite can provide sterile immunity to humans. Studies in mice show clear relevance of T cells, particularly CD8 T cells, for sterilizing immunity to liver stage Plasmodium infection. Importantly, human clinical trials of immunization with RAS are underway. In addition, much recent effort has been directed at developing genetically attenuated parasite (GAP) sporozoite vaccines that may have better safety profiles and provide more reliability than RAS. GAP vaccines are also entering initial human clinical trials. Finally, recent data demonstrate that sporozoite infections under chloroquine drug cover can also generate substantial protective immunity in mice and humans. However, it is unknown which of these whole-sporozoite immunization regimens is most effective at generating protective T cell responses. Given the hurdles inherent in deploying a sporozoite based vaccine in the developing world, pre-clinical insight into the best T cell stimulating vaccines could provide a rational basis to focus evaluation of candidate platforms and substantially accelerate progress toward an efficacious malaria vaccine. As detailed in our recent publication in PLOS Pathogens and highlighted in the preliminary data, we recently applied a surrogate activation marker approach, developed in our laboratory, to track the total T cell response to RAS vaccination in inbred and outbred mouse strains. We now propose to use this approach to characterize the T cell response as well as antibody responses against the spectrum of candidate whole parasite vaccines in order to identify the most potent vaccines in preclinical studies. We will address this knowledge gap through the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Compare the total CD8 T cell response and protective immunity in RAS versus GAP immunized inbred and outbred hosts. Specific Aim 2: Apply a surrogate activation marker approach to dissect the role of CD4 T cells in antimalarial protection after whole-sporozoite immunization. Specific Aim 3: Characterize T cell and antibody responses and protective immunity to live sporozoite infection under chloroquine drug cover in inbred and outbred hosts. Specific Aim 4: Evaluate optimal whole-parasite vaccines for the ability to elicit protective T cell and antibody responses via translationally relevant routes of immunization","6D"
2013,8370498,"5 R01 AI068041-07","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Natural mutations in humans and introduced mutations in mice highlight the importance of the type II cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-3), for control of tuberculosis (TB). How IFN-3 exerts its effects depends largely on the broad transcriptional programs it activates within Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-infected host cells, especially macrophages. Here as many as 1,300 genes may be engaged. Our previous studies identified one member of a 47kDa Immunity Related GTPase (IRG) family - Irgm1 - as important for protection against Mtb in macrophages and in mice. Recent profiling has revealed expression of a second family of IFN-3- inducible GTPases - the 65kDa Guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) - within TB-related signatures of both Mtb- infected human and mouse tissues. Moreover, this expression appears functionally important. Preliminary studies using newly created Gbp-deficient mice find a protective role for these 65kDa GTPases during mycobacterial infection in vivo.  We propose to build on these observations by pursuing two broad inter-related aims. Aim1. To understand how the IFN-3-inducible Gbps mechanistically control Mtb-infection at the level of the infected macrophage and in mice. Here we will focus on three members - Gbp1, Gbp5 and Gbp7 - that exhibit robust loss-of-function phenotypes against mycobacteria and for which initial partner interaction screens have provided some insight into the mechanisms employed. Aim 2. To determine whether these proteins also confer anti-tubercular activity within its natural human host. Here we will functionally examine the corresponding human orthologs - GBP1, GBP4 and GBP5 - in Mtb-infected human macrophages and confirm expression in human TB samples from active and latently infected individuals. Causal relationships will then be established in vivo using a new humanized mouse model amenable to GBP-specific siRNA silencing in immune cells such as macrophages. In addition, we will screen patient and kindred cohorts for loss-of-function GBP mutations that associate with mycobacterial susceptibility in collaboration with J.L Casanova. Both of these strategies should provide evidence for the IFN-3-inducible GBPs conferring protective immunity in nature.  Understanding of the mechanisms employed by these new IFN-3-inducible GTPases has important implications for TB vaccine design, small drug therapy and, more recently, as novel biomarkers for disease reactivation from latency. The latter application in particular represents an urgent unmet need for the TB and infectious disease community.","2D"

The specific aims are: 1) To investigate the role of cocaine/HIV-1 protein-induced synaptic impairment and estrogenic modulation of neuroplasticity. The proposed in vitro experiments will further determine the mechanisms of estrogenic activity and test novel soy isoflavone compounds as potential estrogen ¿-receptor modulators of HIV-protein induced synaptic impairment. 2) To determine the role of estrogen(s) in modulating nucleus accumbens dopaminergic synaptic plasticity following repeated cocaine in chronic HIV-1 protein exposure models. The effects of HIV-1 protein+cocaine on dopaminergic neurochemistry will be assessed using in vivo microdialysis in ovariectomized female HIV-1 transgenic animals. The ability of estrogen/soy isoflavones+ cocaine to produce DAT dysfunction/protection under physiological conditions will be assessed and the behavioral/pathological consequences will be determined. 3) To determine the role of synaptic plasticity in HIV-1 protein+cocaine cognitive behavioral impairments and estrogenic therapeutic effects. Estrogen(s) will be used to modulate cognition and dopamine markers following cocaine and HIV-1, providing insight into potential neuroprotective mechanisms and therapeutic strategies. Investigations will focus on quantifying spine density changes with respect to regulators of nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons and prefrontal cortical neuronal plasticity. The ultimate goal of this research is to identify sensitive targets and unique pharmacological interventions (estrogen ¿-receptor modulators) for preventing cognitive and motor dysfunction (HAND) following cocaine abuse in HIV-1+ special populations.","6G"
2013,8371237,"5 R01 AI096869-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of gene networks that allow fungal pathogens to successfully interpret and respond to the host environment is rudimentary, and lags behind the more sophisticated knowledge of regulatory circuits that govern virulence of bacterial and viral pathogens. We seek to exploit tools we have developed in the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans to approach this question. C. neoformans is an opportunistic yeast pathogen responsible for over 1 million infections and 600,000 deaths annually. In published studies, we identified several transcriptional regulators that control pathogen fitness in infected mice. Pivotal among these is the Gat201 GATA family protein that controls virulence, capsule formation, and the ability to inhibit phagocytosis. We recently determined that Gat201 controls the response of ~16% of the C. neoformans genome to environmental signals. To identify its direct targets we have developed chromatin immunoprecipitation-microarray (ChIP-chip) methods for C. neoformans. Among the genes that are directly bound and regulated by Gat201 are seven transcription factors, suggesting the existence of a transcriptional network. Two of these regulators (Liv3 and Cir1) have been implicated in pathogenicity and we have recently demonstrated that another, Gat204, controls fitness during infection of mice and the inhibition of phagocytosis in vitro. These data suggest that C. neoformans implements a network involving at least four regulators to control virulence. We seek to understand how this network functions. Characterizing targets of this network additionally provides an opportunity to identify novel virulence mechanisms. We seek to identify the mechanisms the network must activate to promote disease. Thus, our aims are as follows: (1) Determine the architecture and functional properties of the Gat201 virulence network. We will define the direct and indirect transcriptional targets of each regulator. Analysis of the network architecture is expected to yield testable predictions that could not be inferred from the study of individual regulators. In parallel, we will determine whether these transcriptional regulators have similar or distinct roles in infection. By delineating the functions of the key transcription factors that control virulence and their relationships to each other and target genes, these studies are anticipated to reveal how regulatory factors collaborate to control the virulence properties of the pathogen. (2) Exploit the regulatory network to identify novel capsule-independent virulence mechanisms. Intriguingly, Gat201 activates the expression of genes coding for three enzymes involved in chitin synthesis. Thus, we will test the hypothesis that Gat201 activates the production of chitin and/or chitin-derived polysaccharides and that these are necessary for C. neoformans to inhibit phagocytosis by macrophages thereby promoting virulence. Should we disprove this hypothesis, an alternative approach will be taken in which we test knockouts in targets of the regulatory network. These studies are anticipated to reveal novel mechanisms whose activation by the network is necessary for pathogen success.","2D"
2013,8372385,"5 R01 AI098616-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2010, the Benner group announced the development of four innovations relevant to tools to detect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in complex biological samples: (a) An artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGIS) that supports  six nucleotide PCR , allowing  independent amplification of small amounts of HIV RNA without interference from other DNA in the environment. (b) A self-avoiding molecular recognition system (SAMRS) that supports essentially unlimited multiplexing in DNA probing, priming, and multiplexed PCR amplification. (c) Procedures that convert standard DNA into AEGIS-containing DNA, supporting downstream orthogonal capture that  allows DNA-targeted assays to be flexible and adaptive, possibly allowing new targets to be added to a multiplexed  assay kit without demanding a reworking of the parts of that kit already targeted. (d) Reversible terminators that, as triphosphates, are hypothesized to allow detection and relative quantitation of variant HIV sequences.  We hypothesize that by combining these innovations, we can improve HIV diagnostics tools, expanding their power to detect fewer virions in more complex biological environments with greater dynamic range and greater subtype specificity, together greater multiplexing. Further, these technologies should deliver flexibility; it should be possible to rapidly add capabilities to detect new variants, co-incident infectious agents, or even identify previously unknown variants at specific sites in the HIV genome in the course of diagnosing HIV infections.  To test this hypothesis, we will perform a staged series of assay development, adding each of these innovations in series to increasingly challenging problems in the detection of HIV target sequences, starting with singleplexed detection of single HIV targets in relatively simple environments, adding innovations as we lower the amount of target molecules, increase the level of multiplexing, and make the environment more complex. At each stage, we will drive the system to fail, and note the parameters (sensitivity, complexity, multiplexing level) at which the system fails. These define a  parameter space  which provides a metric for progress. This project will also make available as deliverables kits of primers, probes, and detection capture beads, to be provided HIV researchers interested in benchmarking or using them.  Although technology from the Benner laboratory stands behind the branched DNA (bDNA) 3.0 tool now widely used to measure HIV viral load, this is the first time that the Benner laboratory has sought funding for AIDS research. Thus, a further goal of this work will be to allow innovations from the Benner laboratory to be more widely used to solve the many HIV-related problems at the NIAID. This will help the NIAID help meet the goal established by the National HIV/AIDS Strategy of increasing the awareness of HIV status from 79% to 90% by 2015 in the US.","1C"
2013,8373763,"2 R01 GM066978-09","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are among the most significant causes of human morbidity and mortality. Worldwide, there are more than 40 million (HIV-1) and 170 million (HCV) people infected with these viruses. In the United States, 0.6% (HIV-1) and 1.7% (HCV) of the population is infected. More than 25% of those infected with HIV are co-infected with HCV (up to 90% of i.v. drug users). Despite the success of highly active anti-retroviral therapy, there remains a need to develop additional drugs targeted to novel receptors that will ensure different susceptibilities to the development of resistance compared to protease and reverse transcriptase, the principal receptors of current drugs. In contrast, current therapies for HCV are  wholly inadequate, and multiple first-generation drugs are needed. Resistance is quickly developed to drugs patterned after those effective against HIV-1. The genomes of both HIV-1 and HCV encode a viroporins, a small membrane protein with ion channel activity involved in the production of new virus particles in infected cells. We propose to take a structural approach to the design of drugs directed against these viroporins. This is technically challenging research because viroporins reside in cell membranes, and one of the most important things we have learned from our studies of membrane proteins is that they are distorted by membrane mimics, such as organic solvents and detergent micelles, and must be studies in their native phospholipid bilayer environment under physiological conditions. As part of this research we have developed a general NMR method for determining the structures of membrane proteins in phospholipid bilayers, and will apply it to these viroporins. Determining the native structures of Vpu (Virus protein  u ) from HIV-1 and the p7 protein from HCV are essential in order to understand the molecular mechanism of their biological activities and to accelerate the discovery of drugs that interfere with the activities that contribute to the infectivity of the virses. Because we express these proteins and domains of their cellular partners in bacteria, we have a great deal of flexibility in the design of experiments to characterize their interactions with both  drugs and proteins.","6A"
2013,8373884,"5 R01 AI051174-12","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cellular ESCRT pathway mediates budding of many enveloped viruses, including HIV-1. This pathway also catalyzes analogous membrane fission reactions during intraluminal endosomal vesicle formation and the abscission stage of cytokinesis. In the case of HIV-1,  late domain  motifs within the viral p6Gag protein bind and recruit two early-acting ESCRT factors, ESCRT-I and ALIX. These factors, in turn, recruit the ESCRT-III and VPS4 complexes, which then collaborate to catalyze membrane fission. During the current funding cycle, we have added to our understanding of HIV-1 budding by: 1) identifying the MVB12 class of ESCRT-I subunits, 2) determining structures of ALIX, both free and in complex with its binding sites on viral Gag and CHMP4(ESCRT-III) proteins, 3) determining structures of ESCRT-III proteins and characterizing their mechanism of autoinhibition, 4) identifying CHMP2 and CHMP4 as the key ESCRT-III subunits in HIV-1 budding, 5) demonstrating that most ESCRT-III proteins can polymerize into helical tubes and filaments, and 6) showing how VPS4 enzymes bind their ESCRT-III substrates and assemble into dodecameric complexes comprising two stacked hexameric rings. During the next funding cycle, we will study how core ESCRT factors form higher-order assemblies that work together to mediate HIV-1 budding. Experiments in Aim1 will focus on characterizing the ESCRT-III/VPS4 membrane fission machinery. Specifically, we will determine how ESCRT-III proteins interact, co-polymerize, and function in virus budding. We will also test whether Vps4 enzymes disassemble ESCRT-III filaments by unfolding individual subunits, translocating them through the central pore of the dodecamer, and releasing them back into the cytoplasm. Experiments in Aim2 will focus on elucidating the regulatory interactions that allow ESCRT factors to co-assemble rapidly, accurately, and reversibly at sites of virus budding. Specifically, we will define the conformational changes required for ALIX activation, test whether ALIX and ESCRT-I function together as a higher-order  supercomplex , and determine how the CHMP5-LIP5 complex activates the VPS4 ATPase. In Aim3, we will attempt to reconstitute HIV-1 budding in vitro. Our strategy will be to assemble pure myristoylated HIV-1 Gag-nucleic acid complexes on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and then use a minimal set of pure recombinant human ESCRT proteins to catalyze membrane fission and release virus-like particles into GUV interiors. Toward this end, we have defined the minimal ESCRT machinery required for HIV-1 budding, developed methods for producing recombinant myristoylated HIV-1 Gag (Myr-Gag) and all of the essential human ESCRT factors, and shown that Myr-Gag-nucleic acid complexes assemble into punctate complexes on GUV surfaces that contain PI(4,5)P2. These experiments will test our ability to reconstitute HIV budding from pure components and provide powerful systems for analyzing HIV assembly and budding in mechanistic detail.","2B"

2013,8374102,"5 R37 AI051164-11","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses statistical challenges that arise in HIV prevention research. Recent progress in prevention from different uses of antiretroviral drugs (in PrEP, microbicides, and treatment), male circumcision, and possibly vaccine has been noteworthy but modest. Combining across these modalities, however, might considerably enhance their effects. To address a crucial question facing policy makers--how best to deploy these modalities--requires knowledge of their combined effects and of the factors that impact on these effects. We propose to facilitate such research by developing efficient methods for analysis of data from observational and randomized studies of prevention interventions and for investigation of factors that may modify their degree of benefit. To do so, we propose to extend methods in variety of statistical areas, including causal inference and semiparametric theory, network analysis, and spatial analysis. We show how knowledge gained from new methods in each area can contribute to the usefulness of those in the other areas. Our first aim is to develop methods for using baseline covariates to improve efficiency of analyses of correlated outcome data that arise in group randomized trials (GRTs) and longitudinal studies; both types of studies are widely used in HIV prevention research. Because the number of experimental units in GRTs may be constrained by resource limitations, we develop methods appropriate for small as well as for large samples, and consider both individual- and group-level covariates. Estimation of network features that are important epidemic drivers from network samples is our second aim. This aim also considers methods for using such estimates in the construction of collections of networks--essential for realistic simulation of epidemics and of the impact of combination prevention interventions on them. These investigations will be useful for assessing whether intervention packages should be tailored to network features (and if so how), both through simulation and in analyses of data from research studies. The third aim develops methods for using data from HIV surveillance, especially of antenatal clinics, to estimate spatial and temporal variation in age-specific HIV prevalence and incidence. Such methods can aid in evaluating the impact of deployment of prevention interventions, especially those which are rolled out in sequentially in different regions.","1C"
2013,8374401,"5 R34 MH087120-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Internet-based venues such as websites, chat rooms, blogs, and bulletin boards are becoming an increasingly popular means for HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) to meet potential sex partners. The anonymity, quickness, and convenience offered by online venues allows for numerous potential sex partners to be identified and screened with the possibility to meet in person. However, there are potential health hazards associated with meeting sex partners online, including an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and thus there is an urgent need for online behavioral interventions to help reduce STI/HIV risks associated with Internet-initiated sexual liaisons. This research application requests 3 years of support to conduct developmental intervention studies to design and field test an online, theory-based behavioral risk reduction intervention for HIV-positive MSM who use the Internet to meet potential sex partners. Guided by the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model of health promoting behaviors we will conduct 3 stages of intervention development research, as follows: (1) perform initial interviews and focus groups with HIV-positive MSM who use the Internet to meet sex partners. Stage 1 will also bring together expert and community consultants to aid in the intervention development. Based on information gained from rapid formative studies, this first stage of research will directly lead to the development a novel online theory-based sexual risk reduction intervention; (2) test the feasibility and acceptability of the newly developed online STI/HIV risk reduction intervention with a sample of HIV-positive MSM who use the Internet to meet sexual partners. Stage 2 will also involve programming an audio-computer assisted interview for data collection; and (3) conduct a randomized field test to determine the potential efficacy of the risk reduction intervention for MSM who use the Internet to potentially meet sex partners. Participants in the field test will be randomly assigned to either receive the newly developed intervention or a time-matched attention comparison condition. Stage 3 will include testing for differences between groups on behavioral risk and Internet use outcomes across a 6-month follow-up period. We will also examine the intervention effects on mediating and moderating constructs of information, motivation, and behavioral skills. The proposed intervention research will therefore develop new STI/HIV prevention strategies delivered exclusively online for use with people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) who use the Internet to meet potential sex partners. The results from this study will provide preliminary data on which to conduct a larger-scale, randomized controlled clinical trial in the future.","5A"

This application responds to PA-07-103 ( Research on Rural Mental Health and Drug Abuse Disorders ) and the PA's stated need for research that will  Study whether individuals with various mental disorders can be treated effectively via telemedicine.  A pilot RCT recently completed by our team showed that a 6-session telephone-delivered, interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) intervention reduced depressive symptoms in 79 HIV- infected rural persons (Ransom, Heckman, et al., 2008, Psychiatric Services). This follow-up RCT will enroll 180 persons living with HIV/AIDS in rural counties in the United States who are diagnosed with depression via telephone interviews. Participants will complete self-administered surveys at pre-intervention, post- intervention, and 4- and 8-month follow-up that assess depressive symptoms (the primary outcome measure), interpersonal problems, social support, and ART adherence. Participants will also provide weekly data (for 41 weeks) via interactive voice response (IVR) systems that assess depressive symptoms (41 weeks) and therapeutic alliance (9 weeks). Ninety (n=90) participants will be randomly assigned to a 9-session, one-on- one, telephone-delivered, IPT intervention and 90 will be assigned to a usual care comparison group. Linear mixed models (LMM) will test if IPT participants report greater reductions in depressive symptoms compared to usual care controls. Analyses of reliable change will test if a greater proportion of IPT participants report clinically-significant reductions in depressive symptoms compared to usual care controls. Using weekly data collected via IVR systems, time series analyses will test if IPT participants report greater decreases in depressive symptoms over a 41-week follow-up period compared to usual care control. Mixed models analyses will assess the importance of therapeutic alliance in telephone-delivered IPT. Public Health Significance: This study will test if nine sessions of telephone-administered interpersonal psychotherapy can reduce depressive symptoms in HIV-infected rural persons, a group that is increasing in size and that experiences great difficulty accessing mental health support services.","5C"

2013,8383058,"5 R01 DE021273-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To explore a unique approach for generating robust long term immune responses at both mucosal and systemic lymphoid tissues in the nonhuman primate model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), we propose to utilize an attenuated rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) vaccine vector developed in our laboratories for oral delivery of a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) immunogen engineered as a fusion protein to include either full length coding sequence or specific domains of flagellin, the agonist for toll-like receptor (TLR)5. TLR5 is a potent activator of mucosal immune responses through activation of dendritic cells (DC), follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) and M cells included within gut and oral cavity mucosal- associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). As such, flagellin has proven to be a potent adjuvant for i) induction of serum and/or secretory antibody responses and for ii) induction of Th1 and Th2 responses in both systemic and mucosal tissues. This oral vaccine approach combines the advantages of a potent TLR adjuvant with a viral vector (CMV) shown to disseminate throughout the host after oral delivery/transmission and to establish a lifelong persistence in the presence of immune responses that limit viral pathogenicity at multiple sites within the host. Furthermore, our attenuated RhCMV vector has been modified by deletion of the RhCMV-encoded viral interleukin (IL)-10 gene (RhCMV IL10) that results in increased inflammation at the site of primary infection in vivo, an abrogation of the inhibition of DC maturation associated with wild type CMV infection in vitro, and attenuated viral replication for safety. Lastly, data has shown that prior immunity to human CMV (HCMV) does not preclude re-infection, implying that a CMV-based vector system may be broadly applied to a vaccine target population irrespective of pre-vaccine immunity to HCMV. We hypothesize that RhCMV IL10 vectors expressing SIV vaccine immunogens delivered orally and systemically will induce superior vaccine antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses in multiple mucosal sites. Also, incorporation of TLR5 agonist adjuvant activity by fusion of flagellin sequences with vaccine antigen will further enhance both innate and adaptive mucosal immune responses and provide a novel oral mucosal vaccine approach for protection against HIV. Accordingly, immunogens (SIVmac239 Capsid) fused with full length and/or specific domains of flagellin will be constructed to generate a vaccine antigen with optimal immunogenicity for mucosal tissues and will be used for generation of candidate RhCMV IL10Capsid/flagellin vaccine vectors (Aim1). Candidate RhCMV IL10Capid/flagellin vaccines will next be tested for immunogenicity (Aim 2) in multiple mucosal and systemic tissues and for efficacy (Aim 3) in RhCMV-seronegative female rhesus macaques by vaginal SIVmac251 challenge. We propose that these novel vectors carry the potential to significantly impact HIV vaccine design.","4B"
2013,8383064,"5 R01 DE021223-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mucosal transmission represents the predominant mode of global HIV acquisition. Oral transmission is rare. However, it does occur, in adults and in infants, with the latter occurring most likely through ingestion of milk from HIV-infected mothers. If an effective vaccine can be formulated for orally delivery, it is likely to protect not only against oral and other mucosal transmission, but also enhance vaccine access through its ease of administration, thus providing a cost-effective preventive approach against HIV/AIDS. Over the past two decades, our lab has demonstrated the feasibility of parenteral immunization with a poxvirus prime/protein boost strategy, resulting in complete or partial protection against mucosal SIV or SHIV challenge in macaques. In this application, we propose to extend these findings and to leverage recent developments in natural Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and oral formulation technologies to explore the possibility of adapting this immunization approach for oral vaccination against HIV/AIDS. The overall hypothesis we propose is that effective oral delivery of poxvirus and protein vaccines in a prime-boost immunization strategy will generate greater oral and mucosal responses than parenteral immunizations, resulting in protection against mucosal challenge. The Specific Aims are: (1) To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of oral delivery of a replication competent, attenuated poxvirus vaccine; (2) To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of protein vaccines adjuvanted with a natural TLR ligand and formulated for oral delivery; (3) To compare the immunogenicity of poxvirus prime and protein boost approach in different oral and parenteral delivery regimens; (4) To evaluate the protective efficacy of oral delivered prime/boost vaccines against mucosal challenge in non-human primate models. Results from these studies are likely to help elucidate the protective mechanisms against HIV/AIDS and inform the clinical development of the poxvirus prime/protein boost immunization concept.","4B"

It has been estimated that there will be no measurable decline of HPV- associated tumors before 2040 (Hellner et al., 2011). Likewise, other HPV-associated angogenital and head and neck cancers are predicted to afflict another 700,000 men and women over this period of time (Hellner et al., 2011). Therefore, research attempts to develop therapeutic vaccines to combat HPV-associated disease remains a high priority. In an on-going effort to improve tumor vaccine delivery and potency, our collaborator and co-founder, Dr. Hu, has discovered that nanoparticles coupled to antigens have significantly improved properties as vaccine carriers. When aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticles were compared head to head to alum (Rehydragel(R)), an FDA-approved vaccine adjuvant, Al2O3 nanoparticles were superior to alum at eliciting an antigen-specific T cell response and eradicating 7 day established tumors. The data presented here show a novel antigen carrier with adjuvant properties that activate dendritic cells to efficiently enhance cross-priming of T cells and improve the antitumor efficacy.  UbiVac proposes to use aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticles conjugated to two known HPV tumor associated proteins E6 and E7 (NP-HPV vaccine) to elicit a strong CD8+ T cell immune response against HPV+ tumors. Successful completion of this project will provide proof-of-concept for treatment of HPV-associated carcinomas and a nanoparticle vaccine platform that can be utilized for other cancer types.","4B"
2013,8383443,"5 R01 AI095098-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The highly polymorphic killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and their HLA class I ligands play a central role in the regulation of natural killer (NK) cells, and in the ability of HIV-1 infected individuals to control virus replication. However, functional studies to address the significance of KIR-MHC class I interactions in immunodeficiency virus infection have been limited by the lack of defined MHC class I ligands for KIRs in non-human primate models. We recently identified Mamu-A*02, an MHC class I molecule present in approximately 20% of Indian origin rhesus macaques, as a ligand for Mamu-KIR3DL05 (3DL05). This interaction was peptide-dependent, since Mamu-A*02 tetramers folded with certain simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) peptides, but not others, stained primary NK cells and transfected cells expressing multiple 3DL05 alleles. Consistent with the function of an inhibitory KIR, target cells expressing Mamu-A*02 (A*02) suppressed the degranulation of tetramer-positive NK cells from 3DL05+ macaques. These observations suggest that SIV, and potentially also HIV-1, may acquire changes in epitopes that increase the avidity of MHC class I ligands for inhibitory KIRs as a mechanism of immune evasion to prevent the activation of specific NK cell subsets. Using KIR- and MHC class I-defined rhesus macaques, we will specifically address this hypothesis, as well as other questions fundamental to the biology of NK cells in immunodeficiency virus infection.     The first objective of this proposal (Aim 1) is to identify additional MHC class I ligands for Mamu KIR3DL01 and -KIR3DL05; two KIRs that are commonly expressed in the rhesus macaque and for which we have identified reagents for staining these receptors on primary NK cells. This aim will build on recent work by our group to provide a broader foundation for investigating the role of KIR-MHC class I interactions in SIV infection. Our second objective (Aim 2) is to address the functional implications of viral peptides that modulate NK cell activation. We will determine the repertoire of SIV peptides that enhance or antagonize interactions with 3DL05, and will test the hypothesis that viral epitopes, which stabilize interactions with inhibitory KIRs, facilitate virus replication in the presence of NK cells bearing these receptors. Our third objective (Aim 3) is to compare longitudinal changes in 3DL05+ NK cells following SIV infection of 3DL05+/A*02+ versus 3DL05+/A*02- animals. The following questions will be addressed; Does the recognition of A*02-bound peptides stimulate or suppress the expansion of 3DL05+ NK cells? Are there phenotypic/functional differences in 3DL05+ NK cells in A*02+ versus A*02- animals? Is there a difference in the recruitment of 3DL05+ NK cells to tissues? These unprecedented studies will provide a better understanding of the importance of KIR-MHC class I interactions in immunodeficiency virus infection, and specifically the role of viral peptides in modulating NK cell activation as a mechanism of immune evasion.","2C"
2013,8383456,"5 R01 GM066682-09","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV-1 surface glycoprotein Env (gp120/gp41) mediates viral entry through a series of coordinated structural changes initiated when CD4 interacts with gp120. Ultimately, the gp41 ectodomain folds into a compact trimer-of-hairpins that brings the viral and cellular membranes into the close proximity required for efficient membrane fusion. These conformational transitions have been delineated, in part, through the use of C- peptide and 5-Helix inhibitors that target the HR1 and HR2 regions of gp41 and block trimer-of-hairpins formation. Our previous work has described the physical basis behind C-peptide and 5-Helix inhibition and quantitatively modeled the relationship between inhibitory potency and fusion kinetics. The experiments outlined in this application explore the structure and dynamics of Env in its native and intermediate conformations. The research will address three fundamental questions regarding the mechanism of viral membrane fusion: How does CD4 binding to gp120 trigger formation of the prehairpin intermediate state? What is the structure of Env in this intermediate conformation? What aspects of gp41 folding from the prehairpin state drive the fusion of viral and cellular membranes? Owing to the unstable nature of Env in its native and intermediate states, these questions are often difficult to address using standard experimental techniques, such as scanning mutagenesis, that require stable proteins in long lived conformations. Our basic approach will be to generate new inhibitors that target the HR1 and HR2 regions, and dissect the mechanism of resistance to them. This strategy takes advantage of the power of natural selection to generate well-behaved mutant Env variants with interesting structural or dynamic properties. The specific aims are: 1) to explore the structure and exposure of the HR1 region using novel inhibitors engineered to overcome standard C-peptide resistance profiles; 2) to probe the structure and exposure of the HR2 region using multivalent inhibitors, and to dissect the mechanisms of resistance to these agents; and 3) to explore the energetic requirements of Env- mediated membrane fusion, and to examine the structure of mutant Env variants trapped in intermediate conformations. Our findings will provide new insights into the dynamic properties of the gp120/gp41 complex critical to the viral entry mechanism and will aide the development of new viral entry inhibitors and HIV-1 vaccines.","4A"
2013,8383475,"5 R01 AI095097-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and HIV coinfection act synergistically to promote hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, but the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear due to a lack of appropriate animal models. The BalbC rag2/?C double knockout (DKO) mouse lacks T, B and NK cells and supports development of a functional human immune system in all lymphoid organs. To promote human liver cell co-engraftment, we introduced a liver-specific inducible suicidal transgene (AFC8) in the DKO mouse. Co-transplantation of human blood and liver progenitor cells in AFC8 mice leads to development of both human liver cells and immune cells in lymphoid/liver organs (AFC8-hu mice). These mice are permissive for HCV as well as HIV infection, support anti-viral human T cell responses, and develop human liver immunopathology (inflammation, hepatitis and fibrosis). I postulate that HIV co-infection may affect HCV-induced liver diseases by enhancing HCV replication; by elevating chronic hepatic inflammation; and by activating hepatic stellate cells to accelerate liver fibrosis. The AFC8-hu model is well suited for elucidating the mechanism underlying HCV/HIV synergy in human hepatic fibrosis in vivo. We propose the following aims: 1) The current AFC8-hu mouse will be improved to support higher human hepatocytes in the chimeric liver. In addition, HCV gt 1a and 2a clones will be tested to establish their infection and pathogenesis kinetics. 2) To study how HIV co-infection exacerbates HCV-induced liver fibrosis in AFC8-hu mice. We will define how HIV infection influences HCV infection, immunopathogenesis, stellate cell activation and liver fibrosis. In addition, the effectof HCV infection on HIV-1 replication and AIDS progression will also be monitored. 3) I propose that HIV coinfection dysregulates human inflammatory and immune responses to contribute to HCV-associated liver diseases. We will define the role of key HIV target cells pDC and Treg that promote HCV-induced liver stellate cell activation and fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. The novel AFC8-hu mouse is unique in providing a small animal model in which these important questions can be addressed. The answers to these questions will have a very significant impact on the field.","2D"
2013,8383477,"5 R01 AI097012-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanism by which Cortistatin A inhibits HIV-1 transcription. Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) is the causative agent of AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). HIV anti-retroviral therapy is based on the administration of drugs in combination, in order to minimize development of mutations that can confer single-drug resistance to the virus. The viral protein Tat, a potent activator of HIV gene expression, is a potential antiviral target. We have discovered that Cortistatin A is a promising anti-Tat drug candidate. Cortistatin A is a steroidal alkaloid isolated from the marine sponge Corticium simplex. We have found that didehydro-Cortistatin A (CA for short), is a very potent inhibitor of Tat- activated transcription of the HIV-1 provirus. CA is extremely efficient at reducing viral output from acutely infected cells as well as from chronically infected cultured cells or freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). The half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of CA for inhibiting HIV in chronic infected cells is less than 0.1 nM and the half maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC50) for CA in cultured cell lines or freshly isolated PBLs is more than 20 5M, which confers to CA a very promising therapeutic index.  We have identified an interaction between CA and Tat and with the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) catalytic subunit. Upon HIV infection, DNA-PK tightly associates with Tat to promote phosphorylation of the transcription factor Sp1, which results in increased HIV-1 transcription initiation, via three Sp1 binding sites in the core of the HIV-1 promoter. Our hypothesis is that CA might repress HIV replication in two ways: by inhibiting Tat-TAR interaction, thereby inhibiting elongation by RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) from the HIV promoter; and/or by inhibiting DNA-PK activation of the transcription factor Sp1 and initiation/elongation of transcription by Pol II. Both routes would result in repression of HIV-1 transcriptional activation. Our specific aims include:  Aim 1.Determine whether CA inhibits HIV-1 Tat-TAR interaction in vitro and in vivo and if CA inhibits transcription elongation from the viral promoter. Assess whether CA inhibits Tat mediated DNA-PK phosphorylation of Sp1.  Aim 2. In-depth assessment of CA toxicity in vivo.  Aim 3. Determine CA effect on HIV-1 replication in humanized mice models.  We will thus elucidate the mechanism by which CA inhibits HIV-1 transcription and evaluate its potential to inhibit HIV-1 replication in humanized mice. In order to generate a backup compound we will evaluate additional analogs generated during the course of this project. These analogs will be subsequently tested in the humanized mouse model.","6A"
2013,8383481,"5 R01 CA080320-14","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The c-MYC gene is among the most frequent sites of mutation for any oncogene in human cancer. Approximately 15% of all cancers exhibit amplification of the c-MYC gene and about 25% of breast cancers have similar mutations. Chromosomal translocations at c-MYC occur in 100% of Burkitt's lymphomas, as well as in the related mouse plasmacytomas. In addition to these gross rearrangements, missense mutations can also play a major role in the oncogenic activity of c-MYC, and more than 60% of Burkitt's and AIDS-associated lymphomas have mutations that alter the protein structure of the already translocated c-MYC gene. From a very different perspective, inherited Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that predispose to various cancers have frequently been mapped within or near the c-MYC gene. Beyond these overt mutations and polymorphisms, it is estimated that up to 70% of all cancers overexpress c-MYC in response to disruptions in various signaling pathways such as Wnt. A major question confronting the cancer field is how these mutations and polymorphisms target c-MYC and its downstream cellular targets to mediate oncogenic transformation, cell cycle progression or apoptosis. Of broader interest is how the c-MYC gene itself is regulated in response to diverse oncogenic signaling pathways. The specific goals of this project are to:  Aim 1: Characterize the missense mutations frequently found in the c-MYC protein in Burkitt's and AIDS-associated lymphomas. Our hypothesis is that these mutations cluster at sites that enhance oncogenic activity and dramatically shift the profiles of c-MYC target genes.  Aim 2: Characterize the function of a novel direct target of c-MYC, the nol5a gene, that is hyperactivated by Burkitt's lymphoma associated c-MYC mutations. Our hypothesis is that the Nol5a protein potentiates c-MYC function through its role in ribosome biogenesis.  Aim 3: Characterize the function of SNPs that map over a large domain on chromosome 8q24, a huge region (>2 Mb) that harbors only a single functional gene, i.e. c-MYC. Our hypothesis is that these SNPs map to very distal regulatory elements that control c-MYC gene expression in specific tissues and predispose (or protect) individuals from colon, prostate and breast cancer, dependent on the particular inherited allele.","2F"
2013,8384785,"5 R01 CA096735-11","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanism of blood cell transformation during leukemogenesis. Chromosomal translocations are frequently involved in the process of leukemia development. Among various translocations, t(8;21)(q22;q22) is reported in 8-20% cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) depending on the genetic background and geographic locations of the population, which makes it one of the most common translocations associated with AML. This translocation leads to the fusion of the AML1 and ETO genes and generates various forms of AML1-ETO fusion proteins. In the previous funding period, we discovered that additional mutations, such as abnormal hematopoietic growth factor signal transduction due to loss of one of the human sex chromosomes or deletion or mutation of the NHR4 zinc finger domain of AML1- ETO, cooperate with t(8;21) in AML development. Furthermore, we identified a DNA and RNA binding domain containing protein called SON that specifically interacts with the NHR4 zinc finger domain of ETO. In the current funding period, we propose to test the hypotheses that disrupting IL-3 and/or GM-CSF signal transduction is a major additional mutation associated with loss of one human sex chromosome in t(8;21) leukemia development and that SON is a critical factor in hematopoietic cells. The studies proposed in Specific Aim 1 will define the role of IL3 and GM-CSF receptor signal transduction in the development of t(8;21) related leukemia. The studies proposed in Specific Aim 2 will characterize the role of SON in AML1-ETO involved leukemogenesis. The studies proposed in Specific Aim 3 will analyze the biological function of SON in hematopoiesis. These studies will address important questions about hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis, which may provide valuable insight into the treatment of leukemia and other cancers.","2F"
2013,8384832,"5 R01 AI065361-07","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that are crucial in the immune surveillance against viruses. However, NK cells fail to control HIV-1. NK cells do not effectively lyse HIV-infected cells despite the ability of HIV-1 Nef to down modulate the ligands for NK cell inhibitory receptors, HLA-A and -B. Moreover, HIV-1 Vpr induces ligands, ULBP-1 and -2, to the activation receptor, NKG2D. The actions of Nef and Vpr are sufficient to activate NK cells but insufficient to trigger NK cells to release their cytolytic granules. For NK cells to degranulate they require the engagement of two receptors, NKG2D and NTB-A. Under normal conditions, NTB-A on NK cells is triggered by NTB-A on CD4+ T-cells. However, HIV-1 Vpu is able to down modulate NTB-A from the infected cells surface and in doing so prevents the responding NK cells from degranulating. Thus, Vpu protects the infected cell from lysis by NK cells. In order to understand Vpu's modulation of NTB-A and its consequence on the NK cell cytolytic response we will: 1) determine the mechanism by which Vpu, through NTB-A down modulation, suppresses NK cytolytic response, 2) determine how Vpu down modulates NTB-A and 3) determine whether and how Vpu from various subtypes and groups of HIV-1 and SIV strains are able to down modulate NTB-A. In the first aim, we will test the hypothesis that Vpu down modulation of NTB-A on HIV-infected target cells prevents the ability of specific intracellular signals originating from NTB-A on NK cells from inducing down stream signaling events involved in facilitating the release of lytic granules. In Aim 1 we will alo examine whether the activation ligands to NK cell activation receptor, KIR3DS1 is able to trigger degranulation in the context of NTB-A down modulation. In the second aim, we will test the hypothesis that Vpu's cytoplasmic tail interferes with host cell proteins that are involved in transporting NTB-A from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane. In the second Aim we will also determine whether and how the transmembrane (TM) portion of Vpu interacts with the TM portion of NTB-A. In the last aim, we will test the hypothesis that Vpu from specific HIV-1 subtypes and groups will have different efficiencies in modulating NTB-A. Moreover, we will determine whether Vpu's down modulation of NTB-A is limited to HIV-1 or whether SIV Vpu down modulates simian and human NTB-A as well. Knowledge of these mechanisms will undoubtedly lead to novel therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring the effectiveness of the NK compartment during HIV- 1 infection.","2C"
2013,8384835,"5 R01 AI097059-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Destruction of CD4+ T cells is considered the primary cause of immunodeficiency manifested by opportunistic infections in HIV-1-infected humans as well as in SIV-infected macaques. Subsequently, HIV/SIV-associated chronic immune activation also has emerged as an important explanation for HIV pathogenesis. Although a clearly-defined mechanism about the cause of this general immune activation has yet to be demonstrated, a microbial translocation theory has been proposed whereby breakdown of the mucosal barrier and mucosal immunity is thought to occur after with depletion of CD4 T cells resulting in systemic exposure to mucosal microbial pathogens and their products (e.g. endotoxin). The cause and effect of this theory of pathogenesis, however, has yet to be elucidated, especially since not all infected individuals with low CD4 T cell levels progress similarly to AIDS. The purpose of this proposal is to examine earlier stages of HIV/SIV-associated pathogenesis that could account for microbial translocation by focusing on the role of macrophages. Macrophages are important components of the innate immune system, link the transition from innate to adaptive immunity, and serve as host cell targets of HIV/SIV infection. In support of the rationale to focus on macrophages in this proposal, our recent data showed a high monocyte turnover in SIV-infected animals compared to control uninfected animals that directly correlated with progression to AIDS. Massive destruction of tissue macrophages observed in the lymph nodes of an infected monkey appeared to contribute to a high monocyte turnover rate. Furthermore, preliminary data indicated that a specific cell subset of recently differentiated macrophages from monocytes were the main target of SIV infection.  The main goal of the proposed application is to address the role of tissue macrophages in the pathogenesis of AIDS using the non-human primate model of SIV infection. The goal of this proposal is to determine if microbial translocation leading to systemic immune activation is due to faltering innate immunity by dysfunctional macrophages. The hypothesis is that damage to specific macrophage cell subsets by SIV infection will compromise the first line of defense in innate immunity, and as a consequence, the bacterial flora of the digestive tract will break through the mucosal barrier to contribute to systemic immune activation and pathogenesis of AIDS.","2C"
2013,8384864,"5 R01 AI077414-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen presenting cells and are recognized as key regulators of the immune system, linking both stimulatory and inhibitory components of normal immunity. While DCs are well characterized with respect to primary and secondary immune responses, their unique role in coordinating central and peripheral tolerance is not fully delineated. It is increasingly evident that the failure of DCs' ability to maintain tolerance can lead to autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases. Consequently, human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has been used as a model pathogen to explore the role of DCs in virus- induced neuroinflammation. HTLV-1 is the etiologic agent of two immunologically distinct diseases; adult T cell leukemia and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HAM/TSP is a chronic demyelinating disease with underlying autoimmune condition in the central nervous system with similarities to multiple sclerosis. The progression of HAM/TSP is characterized by an intense proliferation of chronically activated CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), 90% of which are specific for the HTLV-1 transactivator protein Tax. Several clinical observations suggest that Tax-specific CTL response is at best ineffective and may actually be detrimentally contributing to the neuropathogenesis of HAM/TSP by cross-reacting with neuronal antigens or through bystander cell damage. The genesis (antigen presentation and costimulation), priming (normal or defective), and quality (effector versus exhausted) of this hyperactivated CTL response remain incompletely characterized. DCs are of particular importance with respect to HTLV-1 neuropathogenesis as the development of HAM/TSP is associated with rapid maturation of DCs. HTLV-1 is also known to infect DCs both in vitro and in HAM/TSP patients suggesting that DCs play a critical role in HAM/TSP pathogenesis. The HYPOTHESIS of this proposal is that continuous presentation of Tax peptide by activated DCs to naive T cells and modulation of DC functions by Tax play important role in the induction and regulation of Tax-specific CTL response characteristic of HAM/TSP. The SPECIFIC AIMS to this hypothesis will 1) define the process involved in Tax presentation during direct DC infection and cross-presentation from HTLV-1-infected T cells with respect to the alterations in the biologic, physiologic, and immunologic function of DCs and induction of Tax-specific CTL response; and 2) utilize ex vivo analyses to validate the central role of DCs in regulating antiviral efficacy of CD8+ T cells in HAM/TSP patients within the context of proviral load and Tax expression, the two major risk factors in disease progression. Collectively, these studies will define the involvement of DCs in a virus-associated autoimmune/neuroinflammatory disease and highlight critical functional interactions among immune cells during acquired immunity to a viral agent. Additional information derived from these studies will facilitate the translational research development of novel vaccine and therapeutic initiatives to prevent and/or treat HTLV-1-induced neuroinflammatory disease as well as similar diseases of other etiologies.","2G"
2013,8384875,"5 R01 AI031478-21","ABSTRACT Malaria kills an estimated 1-2 million people (mostly children) every year. For transmission to occur, Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has to complete a complex developmental cycle in the mosquito. Only a small proportion of the parasites survive the entire cycle. Thus, the mosquito is a potential weak link that can be exploited for disease control. Invasion of the mosquito midgut by Plasmodium ookinetes is a crucial step, yet little is known about the molecular mechanisms that operate at this stage. We made two unexpected observations during the current grant period: 1) The surface of Plasmodium ookinetes (the form that invades the midgut) is lined with an enolase-like protein and 2) ookinetes can invade the midgut by more than one pathway, one that can be blocked by the SM1 peptide and another that cannot. One aim of this proposal is to investigate, at the molecular level, the mechanism of midgut invasion. Our first aim will address the following working hypothesis. Enolase expressed on the surface of midgut ookinetes captures plasminogen from the surrounding blood meal. A mosquito type II annexin on the surface of the midgut epithelium binds to both tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) from the blood meal and to ookinete surface enolase. We hypothesize that this bridge facilitates both ookinete docking to the surface of the midgut epithelium and tPA activation of plasminogen into plasmin (a protease). The combination of these two separate but intimately entwined events results in successul midgut invasion. Our second aim is to identify P. berghei ookinete genes that are responsible for the different invasion pathways. This is the first comprehensive study of the mechanisms of Plasmodium invasion of the midgut epithelium. Knowledge generated by these studies may have important implications for the development of multivalent transmission-blocking vaccines.","2D"

Trained as a social/health psychologist, over the past 17 years, she has mentored more than two dozen trainees and developed a thriving program of multi- disciplinary collaborative research focused on positive affect in primary and secondary HIV prevention. Dr. Moskowitz is at an ideal stage of her career for a K24 grant. Support from this award would allow her to leverage her research program to develop the careers of patient oriented researchers. She is currently funded by NIMH to conduct a randomized trial of a positive affect regulation intervention for improving psychological and physical well being in people newly diagnosed with HIV. With the support of the K24 there are two overarching questions that would be addressed by an extension of the research program: (1) for whom does the intervention work and (2) in what delivery format? Co-morbid mood disorders are a significant concern for both primary and secondary HIV prevention. The research portion of this proposal outlines an extension of Dr. Moskowitz's research program that would allow her, together with a team of mentees, to begin to address important questions of safety, efficacy, feasibility and optimal delivery format of the positive affect intervention among people with mood disorders who are at high risk for HIV. The Overall Aims of this K24 proposal are to: (1) Provide expanded mentoring of early career clinicians and trainees in patient-oriented research in the specific areas of positive affect regulation interventions, mood disorders, HIV, and, more broadly, in integration of social and behavioral sciences in patient-oriented research; and (2) Extend the current research program to tailor the content and format of a positive affect regulation intervention to maximize feasibility, safety, and efficacy for people living with mood disorders and to maximize transportability to difficult-to-reach populations who are at elevated risk of HIV by translating the modified intervention to computer-delivered format. The ultimate goal for this program of research is to amplify the public health impact for individuals living with, or at risk for, HIV, by broadening applicability of the intervention and by encouraging widespread dissemination to home and community settings. The K24 would insure sufficient time to pursue this natural progression of Dr. Moskowitz's research while protecting time to devote to mentoring future clinician investigators in patient- oriented research. The plans for development, research, and mentoring were designed to complement each other and to create a synergistic effect of mentoring and research in a new direction of patient-oriented research. The proposed mentoring, research, and career development activities actively leverage existing infrastructure, resources, and training initiatives provided by NIH, including Dr. Moskowitz's active research program, the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, and the Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) at UCSF.","5A"
2013,8384882,"5 R01 AI050732-10","CD4 T cells are crucial to the control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. This major T cell subset is traditionally thought of as providing help for B cells and producing cytokines for activating the effector cells of the immune system. In tuberculosis, the CD4 T cells produce IFN- ¿, a key cytokine to controlling the infection. However, other cells produce IFN-¿ and our previous work demonstrated that depletion of CD4 T cells during chronic M. tuberculosis infection in a mouse did not substantially reduce the IFN-¿ production in the lungs. Thus, we hypothesized that CD4 T cells likely have roles in addition to the production of IFN-¿ for controlling M. tuberculosis infection. In this renewal proposal, we will identify key effector functions of CD4 T cells that must be stimulated for a robust immune response against this pathogen. This includes a close examination of the importance of IFN-¿ throughout infection, and particularly the role of IFN-¿ produced by CD4 T cells (Aim 1). In addition, we will explore other effector mechanims of CD4 T cells, including additional cytokine production, cytotoxic functions, and effects on CD8 T cells (Aim 2) The CD4 memory response against M. tuberculosis is complex. Although most people infected with the organism do not develop disease, in large part due to ongoing immune responses, exogenous reinfection does occur. In our animal models, protection (vaccine or infection- induced) equals only approximately a 10-fold reduction in bacterial numbers. Thus, the immune responses that develop during primary infection or following vaccination may be flawed, or the ability of the challenge infection to appropriately recall the T cells to the lungs may be impaired. We will explore these important concepts in Aim 3. In the past funding period, we have developed and obtained exciting and novel reagents that will enhance our ability to accomplish the stated goals. These include mouse strains, M. tuberculosis strains, and new immunologic assays. This project is the result of a long standing collaboration between two labs: JoAnne Flynn's lab at the University of Pittsburgh and John Chan's lab at Albert Einstein. We work closely on all aspects of the project, perform experiments in both of our labs, publish together, share data and reagents.","2D"
2013,8384889,"5 R01 AI093319-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective for this proposal is to examine a novel approach to improve immune reconstitution (IR) when antiretroviral therapy (ART) is begun in HIV infected persons. This is significant because few individuals achieve normal immunity with current ART and up to 20% people with complete viral suppression have little or no increase in CD4+ T cell counts. Even among those with partial normalization of CD4+ T cell counts in peripheral blood, lymphoid tissues (LT) remain depleted by as much as 50%. This observation may explain persistent defects in immune function among people treated with antiretroviral therapy including poor vaccine responsiveness, increased bacterial infections, and poor control of mucosal pathogens like human papilloma virus and herpes simplex virus. Further, the increasing incidence of non-AIDS related cancer deaths from colon or lung cancer and non-AIDS associated lymphoma among HIV+ persons treated with ARV highlight the need for adjunctive therapies to improve immune function.  Recently we described a process of fibrosis in lymphatic tissues of HIV infected persons that destroys critical structures of the paracortical T cell zone (TZ) of secondary lymphatic tissues important for antigen presentation and T cell homeostasis. The degree to which the TZ becomes fibrotic is indirectly and significantly correlated to the size of the CD4+ T cell population in lymphatic tissues and the magnitude of CD4+ T cell reconstitution in peripheral blood when ART is begun. In our preliminary data we demonstrate in a non-human primate model of SIV infection that antifibrotic therapy with pirfenidone, a drug used for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, limits collagen formation in the TZ and enhances preservation of CD4 T cell populations. We hypothesize that therapies directed at limiting or reversing pathologic fibrosis in LT will restore critical anatomical elements of the TZ which, in turn, will lead to significantly greater CD4+ T cell numbers and function. In this proposal we will use the non-human primate model of SIV induced lymphatic fibrosis that we have developed to determine if antifibrotic therapy given as adjunctive therapy with ART can reverse existing fibrosis and improve immune reconstitution. We will intervene with pirfenidone, with and without ART, at 12 weeks post-infection, a time that approximates chronic infection in humans when ART would be considered. We will measure changes in levels of collagen in LT, changes in CD4+ T cell populations in peripheral blood and lymph node, and functional assessments of immunity with primary and recall responses to antigens. We anticipate finding that ART with pirfenidone will result in a significantly larger CD4+ T cell population and improved immune function than when ART is used alone.","6I"
2013,8385487,"5 R01 DE021291-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Two large scale nonhuman primate (NHP) efficacy studies have convincingly demonstrated that CMV/SIV vectors can 1) re-infect CMV-seropositive rhesus macaques (RM), 2) during re- infection, elicit potent and persistent SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses with a strong  effector memory bias , and 3) protect ~50% of vaccinated RM from progressive SIV infection after limiting dose rectal challenge with the highly pathogenic, CCR5-tropic SIVmac239 virus. The protection manifested in these RM is distinct from previous vaccines in its abruptness and extent, with protected RM manifesting a viral burst in plasma of varying size upon initial infection, followed by immediate control to undetectable levels. Protection correlates with the extent of total SIV-specific CD8+ T cells generation during the vaccine phase, and is stable in the vast majority of protected RM for at least 6 months. These data indicate a novel pattern of protection consistent with very early control, likely taking place in the site of viral entry and/or early sites of viral replication and amplification, and mediated by tissue-resident TEM. To date, our efficacy trials have studied CMV vectors that were systemically administered via subcutaneous inoculation. We have, however, demonstrated that oral inoculation of these vectors can also initiate re-infection of CMV-seropositive RM, and elicit robust SIV-specific T cell immunity. We hypothesize that oral inoculation of CMV vectors, and initial induction of vaccine- generated SIV-specific T cells in a mucosal milieu, might change the character of the resultant SIV-specific TEM, perhaps increasing their representation and function in mucosal sites, and potentially increase the efficacy of these vaccines in protecting against mucosal challenge. In the proposed project we will compare in detail the phenotypic, migratory, functional and gene expression properties of SIV-specific T cells elicited by CMV vectors via systemic vs oral route, and determine whether oral inoculation provides enhanced protection against limiting dose, intra-rectal SIVmac239 challenge.","4B"
2013,8385519,"5 R01 AI093981-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall goal is to define the development, trafficking, and functional properties of a novel gut-homing dendritic cell (DC). These mucosal  ?DC  reside in the intestinal lamina propria and Peyer's patches (PP), and in the bone marrow (BM). Preliminary studies have provided insights leading to the following general hypotheses: a) ?DC are distinct from conventional DC subsets in phenotype, microenvironmental localization, and development. b) They use novel trafficking cascades to home to the gut from their origin in the bone marrow. c) Gut-homing ?DC are key progenitors of intestinal DC populations including CD103+ cDC; and they can also give rise to CCR9+ plasmacytoid DC (pDC). d) ?DC may have specialized roles in mucosal immunity as evidenced by unique TLR responses and effector activities. Thus we hypothesize that ?DC are both specialized progenitors of intestinal DC, and participants in intestinal immune responses. Aims include: Aim 1. To define the precursors and progeny of ?DC: bone marrow development and intestinal DC homeostasis. ?DC, and CCR9+ pDC are generated in Flt3L-stimulated BM cultures. To identify their origin, common DC progenitors (CDP) and other DC progenitors will be sorted from BM, and their development into DC subsets will be monitored by immunophenotyping after in vitro culture. Sorted ?DC will also be studied to evaluate their progenitor and renewal potential in vitro and in vivo. The effects of regulatory factors including retinoic acid on ?DC generation will be assessed. Aim 2. To determine the homing properties of ?DC vs. CCR9+ pDC, and to define trafficking mechanisms involved. Short term homing assays will determine the ability of ?DC to migrate via the blood into the intestines vs. other sites, monitoring localization by flow cytometry of recovered cells from recipient tissues. Immunohistochemistry will be used to ask whether ?DC home to specific target microenvironments in the gut wall. CCR9+ pDC will be studied in parallel for comparison. Neutralizing antibodies, and/or DC from gene-targeted mice, will be used to define novel trafficking mechanisms/cascades involved. Aim 3. To define the effects of activating (TLR ligands) and gut regulatory factors (e.g. retinoic acid) on the progenitor and immunologic activities of ?DC. In addition to their progenitor activities, ?DC stimulate T cells and display unique patterns of cytokine expression. ?DC will be assayed for maturation and altered progenitor ability in response to TLR ligands; production of immunostimulatory vs. modulatory cytokines; and education or imprinting of T cells responding to presented antigen. Regulation of their progenitor vs. immunologic activities by gut-associated factors including retinoic acid and wnts will also be assessed.  Elucidating the origin, function and regulation of intestine-associated DC subsets, as proposed here, will help us understand mucosal immune homeostasis and responses to infection; and has the potential to lead to novel approaches to enhance mucosal vaccination (e.g. for HIV or rotavirus) and to control pathologic inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel diseases or celiac disease).","2B"
2013,8385550,"5 R01 AI085073-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this research is to develop statistical methods for quantifying the effects of interventions to prevent infectious diseases. The main motivating examples are studies of vaccine effectiveness. Two particularly challenging problems in vaccine studies entail assessing (i) indirect effects of vaccination and (ii) vaccine effects on post-infection endpoints. Evaluating (i) is a non-standard problem because indirect effects measure the effect of vaccinating one individual on another individual's health outcome. Assessing (ii) is challenging because infected vaccinees may not be comparable to infected controls. This specific proposal is to adapt and develop modern causal inference methodology for use in evaluating (i) and (ii). Similar research will be conducted motivated by studies to prevent transmission of HIV from mother to child where issues similar to (ii) arise. Specific Aim 1 is to develop statistical methods in causal inference with interference for application in evaluating direct, indirect, total, and overall vaccine effects. Areas of particular emphasis will be development of nonparametric tests and confidence intervals, incorporating baseline covariates, and analysis of data from observational studies. A motivating data set is from a trial of cholera vaccines in Bangladesh. Specific Aim 2 is to develop exact statistical methods in causal inference with principal stratification for application in evaluating vaccine effects on post-infection endpoints. This research will focus on applying the ideas of principal stratification in the small sample setting under minimal assumptions. Comparisons will be conducted between the proposed methods and existing large-sample methods as well as traditional intent-to-treat approaches. The research for this aim is motivated by proof-of-concept clinical trials of vaccines where few events are expected. Specific Aim 3 is to develop causal inference methodology to assess vaccine effects on infectiousness. This research will combine aspects of Aims 1 and 2 since studies to assess vaccine effects on infectiousness typically entail conditioning on infection of primary cases (Aim 2) and the vaccination status of the primary case can affect the infection outcome in exposed close contacts (Aim 1). Methods developed in this aims will be used to estimate the causal effect of pertussis vaccination on infectiousness using data from a study in Senegal. Specific Aim 4 is to develop statistical methods for causal inference with principal stratification and competing risks. This research is motivated by studies to prevent postnatal mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV where HIV-free death and weaning are competing risks. In such studies, investigators are often interested in comparing intervention strategies conditional on survival to a certain time point such that this aim will utilize the principal stratification framework. The methods developed under this aim will be used to estimate the causal effect of antiretroviral therapy on MTCT using data from a recent study in Malawi. 1","1C"

At present, the only available vaccine for TB, Bacillus Calmette-Guirin (BCG), has not proven effective in the prevention of adult tuberculosis. As a result, an improved vaccine for TB is urgently needed. We have recently identified and characterized human, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-reactive, CD8+ T cells restricted by the non-classical (HLA-Ib) molecule MR1. This molecule has not previously been shown to present pathogen associated antigens. T cells restricted by MR1 often use a specific T cell receptor (TCR; V17.2).These cells have been termed Mucosa Associated Invariant T Cells (MAIT). Furthermore, we have also found that lung epithelial cells can be infected with Mtb, and are efficiently recognized by CD8+ T cells.  The specific aims of this proposal are focused on developing an improved understanding of the role that the airway plays in the control of infection with Mtb. We have recently found that MR1-restricted MAIT are capable of recognizing Mtb as well as a variety of other pathogens, and that these and other CD8+ T cells are capable of efficiently recognizing Mtb-infected epithelial cells. At present, the role of airway epithelium in the host response to infection with Mtb remains relatively unexplored. In the first aim the full spectrum of pathogens recognized by MAIT will be characterized with regard to TCR usage. We postulate that the limited TCR usage will correlate with limited diversity with regard to pathogen discrimination. The second Aim will define the intracellular location of Mtb in epithelial cells, and will define critical components in the antigen processing and presentation pathway. Here, we postulate that the immune system has evolved mechanisms to sample the intracellular environment of Mtb. Finally, we will address the role of iNOS in the direct control of Mtb growth. Here, we postulate that the major role of iNOS in humans resides at the level of the lung epithelium.","2D"
2013,8386625,"5 R01 CA035299-30","ABSTRACT The importance of PKC¿ in TCR signals controlling T cell activation and differentiation is well established. The selective requirement of PKC¿ in allergic and autoimmune diseases, but not in antiviral responses, highlights it as a promising drug target. Realization of this potential requires a clear understanding of the mechanism(s) that regulate the unique, non-redundant functions and highly selective immunological synapse (IS) localization of PKC¿ in T cells, which remain unknown. Our work during the last funding period revealed that within the large PKC family, PKC¿ represents a unique paradigm with respect to the mechanisms that regulate these events and, ultimately, lead to the activation of critical transcription factors, which determine T cell fate. We propose to apply a multi-disciplinary approach in order to address the following unresolved questions: Aim 1) Positive regulation of PKC¿ activation and localization. Using biochemical, genetic, imaging and biophysical approaches, we will address the hypothesis that the localization and activation of PKC¿ in T cells are positively regulated by specialized mechanisms and plasma membrane interactions owing to the unique properties of its regulatory C1 and V3 domains. We will conduct a detailed structure- function analysis of the C1A, C1B and V3 domains of PKC¿, their phosphorylation, and their interaction with binding partners. Aim 2) Autoinhibition by the PKC¿ C2 domain. Our studies indicate that the PKC¿ N- terminal C2 domain negatively regulates its function, and that autoinhibition is relieved by TCR-induced phosphorylation of Tyr-90, and, furthermore, that C2 itself is a pTyr- and PIP2-binding domain. We will investigate the mechanisms through which autoinhibition is effected, and characterize C2-binding ligands and their functional significance. We will pursue Aims 1 and 2 as a collaborative consortium with Dr. Wonhwa Cho (U. Illinois), who will provide his expertise in biophysical and two-photon imaging approaches to further elucidate the specialized mechanisms that regulate PKC¿. Aim 3) Regulation of Ca2+/NFAT signaling by PKC¿. PKC¿-/- T cells display a Ca2+/NFAT signaling defect, but the mechanism linking PKC¿ to Ca2+ signaling is unknown. Based on our recent findings, and given the important role of Ca2+ signaling in determining the balance between productive T cell activation and anergy/apoptosis, we will characterize this pathway. Specifically, we will address the hypothesis that PKC¿ mediates a positive feedback loop that promotes PLC¿1 activation and, hence, Ca2+/NFAT signaling, via its functional and/or physical association with Tec family tyrosine kinase(s). Our studies will elucidate novel mechanisms that control the unique membrane localization and function of PKC¿ in T cells. The new information will likely provide a rational basis for using PKC¿ as a drug target in autoimmune and allergic diseases, and in T cell malignancies.","2F"

Effective vaccines against HSV that can either prevent or modify the severity of disease expression neither exist nor are on the horizon. About 20% of keratitis cases result in chronic inflammatory reactions in the stroma. These stromal keratitis (SK) lesions are usually managed by prolonged treatment regimens that are often unsatisfactory. Improved treatment approaches are required. These need to inhibit steps in the pathogenesis of SK that are responsible for tissue damage and to stimulate the activity, or provide surrogates, of host components responsible for healing and repair of the cornea. Identifying events in SK pathogenesis that are accessible for therapy can be accomplished most effectively using animal models of the human disease, all of which unfortunately have their shortfalls. We use the tractable primary ocular infection model in mice where the pathogenesis of lesion expression has many similarities to the human disease. From past studies, it appears that the most accessible steps for therapeutic management in the pathogenesis of SK are to: a) prevent events that initiate the influx of inflammatory cells to the stroma, b) counteract the development and extent of corneal neovascularization (CV) that both facilitates inflammatory cell entrance and also contributes to visual impairment and c) remove and/or blunt the function and products of inflammatory cell types responsible for causing tissue damage in the stroma, and expand events that are counter-inflammatory and promote resolution. Our proposed research is to understand at a fundamental level how the essential step of CV is triggered by HSV infection and can be controlled by appropriate forms of therapy. These studies will focus on the role that the cytokine IL-17A plays in the stimulation of new blood vessel formation and on approaches that can be used to inhibit the angiogenic effects of IL-17A. We shall also determine how the CV responses to the major angiogenic factor VEGF are regulated by events that include vessel stabilizing ligand/receptor interactions and micro RNA expression in VEGF responding cells. These observations are expected to result in the design of new therapies that control the extent of CV. Additional studies are designed to further define the role of neutrophils and proinflammatory T cells in orchestrating SK and the use of therapies that counteract their activities. These therapies will include derivatives of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as resolvins and protectins which are both anti-inflammatory and promote tissue repair. We shall also use drugs that activate aryl hydrocarbon receptors expressed by activated T cells, which should inhibit the inflammatory activity of such cells as well as expand the representation of regulatory T cells. The final Aim will be to use drug combinations that target different steps in SK pathogenesis which are expected to have improved efficacy compared to single therapies to control disease severity and mediate tissue healing.","6D"

Both opioids and the neuropeptide substance P (SP) play important roles as a modulator of neuroimmuno-regulation and are involved in modulation of the CNS and immune system. The goal of this project is to address our overarching hypothesis that the interactions between opioids (e.g., morphine) and SP have a cofactor role in the immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 disease and neuroAIDS. We propose a series of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies (Aims 1, 2 and 3) to examine the role of opioids and/or SP in suppression of host innate immunity against HIV-1 infection in both immune and neuronal systems. We will focus on the impact of opioids and/or SP on type 1 IFN- and APOBEC3G/3F (newly identified ant-HIV factors)-mediated innate immunity against HIV-1, as these cellular factors are the key elements of anti-HIV host-defense mechanism. We also will illustrate the in vivo implications of opioid-mediated alterations of type 1 IFN-1/2 and APOBEC3G/3F expression using the specimens (PBMC and brain tissues) obtained from opioid-dependent and non-opioid-using subjects with HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment. We propose the following specific aims to address previously unrecognized mechanisms by which opioids and /or SP compromise IFN/APOBEC-mediated innate immunity, increasing the susceptibility of immune and the CNS cells to HIV-1 infection and injury. In aim 1, we will examine whether opioids and/or SP impair type 1 IFN/APOBEC-mediated innate immunity against HIV-1 infection of the immune cells, CD4+ T cells and macrophages, the primary target in the peripheral blood for HIV-1 infection; In aim 2, we will determine whether morphine and/or SP impair type 1 IFN and APOBEC-mediated innate immunity in the CNS cells: microglia, astrocytes and neurons; In aim 3, we will examine the in vivo impact of opioid use and/or HIV on the expression of type 1 IFN-1/2 and APOBEC3G/3F in the CNS. We will examine the mRNA levels and the localization of protein expression of type 1 IFN-1/2 and APOBEC3G/3F in the brain specimens from opioid-dependent and non-opioid using subjects with HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment. The proposed studies, if successful, will contribute to a better understanding of the role of opioids and/or SP in the impairment of specific and critical innate immune defense mechanism in both immune and neuronal systems. Our studies also will facilitate a rational basis for practical guidance towards the reduction of risk factors, such as heroin, that may potentiate HIV-1 infection and promote the development and progression of neuroAIDS.","2G"
2013,8386652,"5 R01 CA138811-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human tumor virus, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), encodes multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) that are expressed during latent infection in tumors. Two groups of miRNAs have been identified. One group is only expressed in transformed lymphocytes in Type III latency. The second group containing two clusters is produced from a complex family of transcripts, termed BARTs, from the BamHI A region of the genome. Importantly, these transcripts are highly produced in EBV-associated tumors but are expressed at low levels in infected B-lymphoid cell lines. Several of the EBV miRNAS are highly conserved with those identified in rhesus EBV with considerably greater homology than EBV/KSHV coding sequences. This conservation of sequences suggests that the miRNAs might target cellular messages. Based on these findings, this application will test the hypothesis that the EBV BART miRNAs target cellular genes to affect growth regulation. The proposed experiments will use a combination of bioinformatic, microarray, and proteomics to identify the cellular targets of the BART miRNAs. Cell lines that stably express the BART miRNAs will be produced to confirm expression and to determine the effects of the miRNAs on cellular growth properties. Multiple cellular signaling pathways are affected by EBV transforming proteins so potential modulation of these pathways by the BART miRNAs will also be examined. The effects of loss of miRNA expression in EBV infected cells will be assessed using antagomirs, sponges, and inhibitors of miRNA synthesis. Cellular miRNAs have been shown to be major factors in the development of cancer. This proposal will determine how the EBV miRNAs contribute to EBV-mediated oncogenesis.","2F"
2013,8386891,"5 R01 MH093271-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infection of the central nervous system with HIV-1 can trigger a cascade of defense mechanisms that are aimed at blocking expression of the viral genome at various stages of its life cycle. In turn, HIV-1 has evolved several regulatory events via its accessory proteins, more notably Tat, to overcome the cellular defense pathways and through a series of diverse modulatory event induces maximum damage to the cells while ensuring a productive viral life cycle in the infected cells. Recently, much attention has been focused on the impact of HIV-1 infection on host cell homeostasis, more specifically the interaction of HIV-1 with cellular pathways that control chromosomal integrity via homologous and non-homologous DNA repair. While the role of HIV-1 Vpr in affecting DNA damage is well documented, recent observations (shown here) point to the ability of Tat in the induction of Rad51 expression in primary microglia and astrocytes, the two cell types that play an important role in neuropathogenesis of AIDS. This observation corroborates the results from infection studies showing increased levels of Rad51 in HIV-1 infected microglia and astrocytes in culture and in AIDS brain with HIV encephalitis. Rad51 is the major regulator of the homologous recombination repair pathway that in coordination with other cellular proteins ensures chromosomal integrity. Evidently, unscheduled activation of Rad51 may have an adverse impact on several cellular pathways and in some instances even compromise chromosomal integrity. Interestingly, induction of Rad51 by Tat protein may have a positive feedback effect on HIV-1 promoter activity in microglia and astrocytes. In this respect, our preliminary data point to the possible recruitment of NF-B and cyclin T1, the two regulators of HIV-1, by Rad51 for stimulation of the LTR in CNS cells. All these observations provide a rationale for us to hypothesize that the reciprocal interaction of HIV-1 through its transactivator, Tat, with the host recombination repair regulator, Rad51 creates a condition that leads to activation of the HIV-1 promoter in microglia, astrocytes and possibly macrophages, and alters host recombination repair pathways in favor of HIV-1. In this application, we seek support to launch a series of well-integrated molecular, virological, and cellular studies to decipher the molecular events associated with cross-communication of HIV-1 and host DNA repair machinery and develop a strategy, based on our observations, to inhibit HIV-1 gene expression and activation in cells that support viral infection. Throughout our studies the relevance of our molecular discoveries to the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 will be verified at every stage through the use of a unique collection of brain specimens from HIVE patients (provided by the Manhattan Brain Bank). Thus, through this novel integrated approach, our studies will provide important information relevant to HIV-1/CNS diseases that can be used to improve the current method for treatment of AIDS patients with neurological disorders.","2G"
2013,8386911,"5 R01 AI050468-10","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is one of the most common opportunistic infectious agents in AIDS patients. Viral infections in the spleen are believed to contribute to pathogenesis and virulence of systemic infections since highly active viral replication in the spleen, common in immunocompromised hosts, usually leads to lesions in the organ and impairs its function for control of viral infection. During primary infection, the viruses produced in the spleen disseminate to other organs and represent one of the major sources for subsequent infection of many organs. Moreover, the spleen is also a site for viral persistent and latent infections. Thus, CMV replication in the spleen is a major determinant of viral virulence and pathogenesis. However, little is currently known about the mechanism of how CMV replicates in the spleen. Equally elusive is the nature of viral determinants required for CMV infection in the organ.  Using murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection in immunodeficient animals as a model system, the proposed research is to study viral genes required for CMV replication in spleen and to investigate the roles of these viral determinants in supporting CMV infections in splenic tissues and cells. We have recently developed a novel approach to construct MCMV mutants and have isolated two novel mutants that are defective in growth in spleens and exhibit little virulence in killing immunodeficient animals. One mutant was attenuated to grow in splenic cells while the other failed to modulate NK cell-mediated response in spleens. In the proposed research, we will first study how these two mutants are defective in infecting spleen tissues and cells. We will then characterize the mutated ORFs, which encode MCMV determinants for viral infection in spleen. Furthermore, host factors that potentially interact with these viral ORFs will be identified and their interactions with viral proteins will be examined. Finally, we will investigate the mechanism of how the identified viral determinants function in supporting MCMV infections in spleens, including in modulating dendritic cells and in blocking NKG2D-ligand interactions. These studies will characterize viral determinants for infection in spleens and elucidate the role of these genes in enhancing viral virulence and causing CMV systemic infection. Studying viral virulence factors and understanding their roles in CMV pathogenesis will provide insight into developing novel approaches for the treatment of CMV-associated complications, including those associated with AIDS patients.","2D"
2013,8386919,"5 R01 AI076498-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of our work is to develop a successful anti-malaria vaccine. The burden of malaria, with up to two million deaths per year due to Plasmodium falciparum infection, illustrates the urgency for such a vaccine. In particular, we propose herein to study the immunological basis for the protective immunity against pre-erythrocytic stage parasites that is induced by immunizations with distinct genetically attenuated parasite (GAP) in mice. Understanding the mechanisms involved in protective immunity could then provide the foundation for rational design and development of an effective malaria vaccine. Preliminary data indicate that LS parasites may be the predominant targets of protective immunity and that LS proteins also contribute to the induction of protective immunity induced by GAP vaccines. Using P. yoelii GAPs (PyGAP) as model, we demonstrated that one genetically deficient parasite [Pyuis4(-)] induced more potent and prolonged protective immunity than another [Pyuis3(-)], and that mice immunized with different GAPs recognized different antigens. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the variation in protective immunities induced by different GAPs may involve different immune mediators and a divergent profile of immune biomarkers and target antigens that distinguish protective from non-protective, and short-lived from long-lived, immunity. In this project, we propose to test our hypothesis via three aims: In aim 1, we will establish a systematic model of protective immunity following three different PyGAPs and irr-spz immunization that represent a range of protective immunity - complete long-lasting, partial and short-lived, or non-protective immunity against wild type P. yoelii sporozoite challenge. We can then characterize T cell responses (magnitude, phenotypes and proliferation) associated with the different degrees and durations of protective immunity in different trains of mice. In Aim 2, we will determine the distinctive immune biomarkers that associate with differentially protective immunity induced by different PyGAPs. Aim 3 will delineate the effector mechanisms of protective CD8 T cell responses induced by PyGAP. The outcome of this study, a better understanding of the T cell-mediated immunity, identification of immune biomarkers of protection against malaria infection, and effector mechanisms of protective immunity induced by PyGAP vaccines, will be invaluable for development of an effective subunit malaria vaccine.","6D"

This proposal aims to study a protease called plasmepsin V. It has recently been discovered that plasmepsin V recognizes and cleaves a sequence on the proteins that the parasite has designated for export. This is crucial for proteins to get out into the host cell. The proposal addresses the questions: What is special about plasmepsin V compared with mammalian counterparts? What is the specificity of this enzyme for its substrate? How does plasmepsin V interact with other cellular components to ensure that proteins to be exported get to their destination? The proposed experiments will involve enzymology, site-directed mutagenesis and protein-protein interaction studies. The goal is to understand plasmepsin V function to inform antimalarial drug development efforts.","2D"

The purpose of this R01 pilot study is to develop and then test the feasibility of implementing a parenting intervention for HIV-infected mothers with well children age 6 - 14 years old. The intervention is designed to improve parenting skills and maternal self-care skills in order to improve child and maternal outcomes. The basis for development of this intervention is work from two previous R01s (MH # 5R01MH057207, currently Yr. 12) designed to longitudinally assess HIV-positive mothers and their children. MLH (n = 60) and their children (total N = 120) will be recruited, randomized to a theory- based, skills training intervention or a control condition, and assessed at baseline and 3, 6, and 12-month follow-ups. The intervention ( Improving Mothers' parenting Abilities, Growth, & Effectiveness -the IMAGE program) will consist of 5 sessions, and will be based on the Information - Motivation - Behavioral Skills (IMB) model of health behavior change, with specific skills selected based on our 10-year observational study of MLH and their children, which is on-going at UCLA. A random subset of 40% of the intervention mothers (n = 12) will be asked to participate in an in-depth qualitative interview after their last follow-up, to obtain detailed process information on their experiences in the intervention. The main aims of this randomized pilot trial are to: 1. develop the intervention and then evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the 5-week, theory based, individual behavior intervention to enhance positive parenting skills of MLH; and 2. conduct preliminary evaluation of the data for effect sizes and investigate trends in the data for:  a. parenting practices outcomes (utilizing the parent practices scale), and secondary outcomes of  parenting efficacy;  b. parenting behaviors targeted (parent-child communication, parental monitoring, family routines, and  appropriate parentification), and the self-care skills targeted (social support, disclosure, dealing with  perceived stigma);  c. maternal outcomes for mental health indicators and physical health indicators;  d. child outcomes of mental health indicators, behavioral problems, and self-concept and coping; and  e. family outcomes (family functioning, parent-child relationship).  We are now in the third decade of the HIV epidemic, and few interventions, other than for prevention or medication adherence, are available for women living with HIV; this study will be the first step in the evaluation an intervention that will assist HIV-positive mothers in dealing with the stress of parenting while coping with HIV. The pilot data will lead to a future application for a full-scale trial of the intervention to test efficacy.","5C"

2013,8388814,"5 R01 CA132136-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) infect mucoasal and cutaneous epithelium. About 6.2M new cases of sexually transmitted HPV infections are reported every year, and >20M people in the US are currently infected. HPV infections cause anogential cancers, especially cervical cancer, and are linked to >99% of all cervical malignancies. HPV types 16 and 31 cause anogenital infections and related cancers, but each causes a distinct infectious outcome and the viruses have different biological characteristics. Major obstacles in HPV research have included the lack of high-titer infectious viral stocks and the lack of an in vitro assay system for the study of early infection phases and viral gene expression. We have been successful in generating high-titer HPV virion stocks and we show evidence that oncogenic HPV types HPV16 and HPV31 interact differently with normal host cells, human keratinocytes (HKs). HPV16 has an internalization half time (t1/2) of ~4h, whereas the t1/2 for HPV31 is ~14h; HPV16 enters via clathrin-coated pits, but HPV31 uses a clathrin-independent, caveolae- and dynamin 2-dependent pathway in HKs that involves lipid rafts. Unlike previous studies, we will investigate bona fide HPV infections in normal host HKs. We will use a combination of multi-parameter confocal and video microscopic visualization (localization) and infectious entry assays (detection of viral transcription) to assess the routes of infection of normal host cells. Our central hypothesis is that specific external viral capsid features dictate the dissimilarities in the early infection events of HPV16 and HPV31 in HK. We will exploit the differences between HPV16 and HPV31 to pursue this program's goals, which are to identify the viral and cellular factors and define the mechanisms dictating the viral infection process in host HKs. To test our hypothesis, we will pursue three inter-related Specific Aims: In Aim 1 we will determine the viral and cellular factors affecting initial interactions with HKs. This will employ mixed virions comprised of HPV16 L1+HPV31 L2 (or HPV31L1+HPV16L2) and video microscopy of single particle tracking on host cells. In Aim 2 we will determine the requirement for intracellular signaling in virion entry and trafficking. In Aim 3 we will use novel dual fluor-labeled infectious particles created in our lab to delineate the route of intracellular trafficking and the location of virion uncoating. These studies will reveal the intracellular vesicles involved, and investigate the role of L2 in vesicle escape. We are employing established techniques for studying virus internalization and trafficking, now possible for HPVs due to the availability of high-titer viral stocks. This work will provide a foundation for defining the molecular mechanisms that control the establishment of HPV infections. Understanding the processes of viral entry will impact future development of broadly cross-protective prophylactic strategies for preventing persistent oncogenic HPV infections, a major risk for morbidity and malignant progression. Our findings will also provide significant insight into receptor-mediated endocytosis in keratinocytes, an area vastly understudied.","2F"

Botswana also has been the world's leader in providing universal free access to AZT, prevention of mother to child transmission, an extensive network of VCT centers, and a nationwide male circumcision program. However, this emphasis on biomedical strategies for case finding, care, and treatment has not been paralleled by primary prevention programs. The new national strategic plan to be issued in 2010 now places importation and adaptation of evidence-based behavioral prevention as the highest strategic priority for the immediate future. It is in response to the new strategic plan that this collaborative R34 proposal to adapt and pilot an evidence-based program, the Becoming a Responsible Teen (BART) intervention, for Batswana youth is submitted. Guided by a teen advisory committee and a community advisory board, we will conduct focus groups with youth and in-depth interviews with key informants in the first year to inform adaptation of the measurement protocol and intervention for youths 14-19 in Gabarone secondary schools. In the 2nd year, measures will be pilot tested to establish their psychometric properties and to compare responses by gender. Role play vignettes will be drafted, their social and ecological validity assessed, and the BART intervention will be adapted for Batswana adolescents. New culturally appropriate modules addressing alcohol as a risk factor, conflict resolution to reduce intimate partner violence, and stigma reduction will be added. In addition, a new 3-session intervention for parents and a separate 3-session program for household caretakers will be added, addressing HIV/AIDS information, communicating with youth on sensitive topics, and monitoring, In the 3rd year, a pilot feasibility study will assess recruitment, retention, interventionists' fidelity, and youth and parents/caretakers' response to their respective interventions, and whether the results suggest that the Botswana version of BART provides value added when compared against the existing Life Skills curriculum in the secondary schools. This developmental application is the first step in a programmatic sequence developed in collaboration between the University of Botswana, governmental agencies and NGOs in Gaborone, and Mississippi State University. If the feasibility trial documents positive changes in behavior, it will inform a R01 application for a larger randomized controlled trial with cognitive, behavioral and biological endpoints. If the RCT provides strong evidence of effectiveness, we will work with the Ministries of Education, Health, and Youth and Culture to disseminate the intervention throughout Botswana's secondary schools and train staff in each community to deliver the program with fidelity.","5A"
2013,8389623,"5 R01 AI087452-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular basis of myelomonocytic receptor function in HIV-1 infection ABSTRACT Harnessing the potent antiviral activities of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-specific T cells is critical to the design and development of effective HIV-1 vaccines and immunogens. To do so, a clear understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms that influence the evolution and immunoregulatory function of these cells is needed. In previous collaborative work, the PI and co-PI discovered a novel regulatory mechanism for HIV-1-specific T cells, which depends on the interactions of inhibitory and activating myelomonocytic major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) receptors on dendritic cells and monocytes with HIV-1 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope/MHC-I complexes. We have found (i) that binding between these molecules is both antigenic peptide- and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele- specific, (ii) that HIV-1 CTL escape mutations increase peptide/MHC-I (pMHC-I) affinities for inhibitory myelomonocytic receptors causing dendritic cells to become tolerogenic, and (iii) that HLA class I alleles that are known to be HIV-1-protective in humans bind activating myelomonocytic receptors with increased relative affinities. In these ways, and perhaps others, myelomonocytic receptors play key and previously unrecognized immunoregulatory roles in the adaptive immune response to HIV-1 viremia. Here, we propose that determining the molecular basis of pMHC-I/myelomonocytic receptor interactions and that the targeted manipulation of these binding events will lead to novel and improved HIV-1 vaccines and immunogens. We aim to determine a comprehensive structural, energetic and functional basis for molecular specificity in pMHC-I/myelomonocytic receptor interactions in order to provide a clear rational for including specific peptide epitopes in HIV-1 vaccines and to engineer affinity-matured myelomonocytic receptor variants to act as HIV-1 immunogens.","2B"
2013,8389629,"5 R01 AI053709-11","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sporozoites of mammalian malaria parasites infect hepatocytes and therein the parasite develops as a liver stage. Liver stages are obligatory for infection, undergoing rapid growth and development, resulting in the formation of tens of thousands of red blood-cell infectious merozoites. Liver stages remain the least understood of all malaria life cycle stages and have only recently become amenable to systematic, detailed study. This is important as the liver stage is a promising target for new treatment and prevention modalities directed to halt parasite development prior to clinical manifestations of infection, either drugs or vaccines. Liver stages reside in a vacuolar compartment (parasitophorous vacuole, PV) that acts as a barrier to direct contact with the host hepatocyte cytoplasm. Consequently, any interaction of the parasite with its host cell takes place through this interface. We hypothesized in our initial grant that invasive sporozoites and liver stages export proteins that are targeted to the PV membrane (PVM) and that these proteins would be critical mediators of liver stage-hepatocyte interactions. Data generated from our studies provided convincing evidence in support of this hypothesis. We identified UIS3 and UIS4, small transmembrane proteins first expressed in the invasive organelles of sporozoites, later inserted into the PVM after invasion and continuously expressed during liver stage development. Independent deletion of UIS3 or UIS4 in rodent malaria parasites resulted in mutant parasites that are growth-arrested at the early liver stage, showing that UIS3 and UIS4 are each critical for successful liver stage development. We further determined that UIS3 directly interacts with host liver-fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) and demonstrated that liver stage growth is directly proportional to L-FABP expression levels in hepatocytes. As such, this competitive renewal proposes to enhance our understanding for the functional role of parasite-host interface proteins to support Plasmodium liver stage growth and development. In our first aim we will map the interacting amino acid residues of UIS3 and L-FABP to determine if it is the direct interaction between these two proteins that is critical for parasite growth. We will also test L-FABP knockout mice for susceptibility to sporozoite infection and liver stage development. In our second aim we will identify hepatocyte proteins that interact with UIS4 and determine their importance for liver stage growth. The third aim will characterize recently identified novel putative liver stage-specific PV proteins and determine their significance for parasite growth in hepatocytes. In aims 1 and 2 we will expand our analyses of rodent parasite-host interactive proteins to human P. falciparum. The results of this project will present important data on mediators of liver stage-hepatocyte interactions that are essential for liver stage growth and survival. These interactions may be exploited for the design of novel strategies to prevent malaria infection.","2D"

This concept is supported by the findings from studies that document a) an important role of the cellular lineages that comprise the innate immune system during acute infection, b) the findings from studies of whole genome association that the rate of disease progression is linked with several genes among them is the association with the HLA-C region known to interact with killer cell immunoglobulin inhibitory receptors (KIRs) expressed by NK cells c) Specific KIR alleles influence the effectiveness of NK cell activity in the containment of HIV replication d) our data of a strong association of KIR3DL.11 allele with spontaneous viral load control in SIVmac251 infected Mamu-A01+ rhesus macaques c) our lab derived preliminary data of an association between differences in the kinetics of marked rapid increases during the acute infection period in the frequency and absolute numbers of HLA-E tetramer+ cells that express the gut homing marker alpha4/beta7 in SIV disease-resistant sooty mangabeys. The fact that the kinetics are also faster in SIV-infected long term non-progressor rhesus macaques as compared with MHC haplotype identical SIV-infected regular progressor rhesus macaques underscores the importance of this finding. We submit that a more detailed study of the kinetics of the appearance of sub-lineages of NK cells, the family of KIRs that are expressed and the cytokine/chemokine profile of each of these subsets is warranted. Our ability to functionally deplete this cell lineage in vivo during acute and/or chronic infection using a JAK3 inhibitor combined with our ability to in vitro expand and infuse large number of defined autologous NK cells and track them in vivo provide us with unique and powerful tools to do the subtract/add cell lineage experiments that we submit will provide important clues as to the role this cell lineage plays during the acute and chronic infection period. We submit that the studies outlined will provide important insights on mechanisms by which the innate immune system influences events during the acute infection period and provide avenues that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit of HIV-1 infected humans.","2C"

This goal will be pursued in local cohorts of HIV-1 infected individuals who control their infections in the absence of anti-retroviral therapy (JAIDS, 50:403-8, 2009). Approximately 13% of these individuals have circulating broadly neutralizing antibodies providing the study population for our studies. A key element of our approach is the development of a new assay to census Env-specific memory B cell clones (BMem) that allows the rapid and direct cloning of full-length molecular clones of the antibodies expressed by these cells (PNAS, 106:3952-7, 2009). This method permits clone identification using native oligomeric HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env) expressed on cell surfaces and by direct neutralization of pseudoviruses. Env-reactive clones are used to produce mAbs that will be evaluated for epitope specificity and neutralization breadth. This information will be used to test the hypothesis that neutralization breadth is determined by monoclonal or pauciclonal responses comprised of one or a very few neutralizing specificities as opposed to a polyclonal response comprised of a mosaic of neutralizing specificities. There are two specific aims. Aim 1- To develop clonal specificity profiles of Env-specific BMem from NVS who have ongoing broadly neutralizing antibody responses- Clonal specificity profiles of anti-Env responses will be determined by limiting dilution analysis, mAb isolation, and epitope mapping to identify broadly neutralizing mAbs.

The identity of this inhibitor has recently been revealed: it is the transmembrane, GPI-anchored protein BST-2, also known as HM1.24, CD317, or  tetherin.  BST-2 seems able to affect diverse enveloped virions, suggesting a broad role in the host defense against viruses including HIV-1. The research proposed here has three specific aims: 1) to reveal how BST-2 retains HIV-1 virions on infected cells; 2) to determine how Vpu antagonizes this restriction; 3) to understand the regulation of BST-2 during the innate immune response and to explore the potential function of BST-2 in antigen presenting cells. These aims will be pursued using a concerted experimental approach including targeted mutagenesis of BST-2 and Vpu, characterization of the interaction between BST-2 and Vpu, analysis of the effects of Vpu on the intracellular trafficking and virion-incorporation of BST-2, and analysis of the regulation and function of BST-2 in primary T lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells. When these aims are completed, we will know how BST-2 retains virions on infected cells, how Vpu counteracts this protein, how BST-2 is regulated during the innate immune response, and whether it plays a role in the uptake of virions by antigen presenting cells during the adaptive immune response.","2B"
2013,8389647,"5 R01 AI088075-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis kills about 2 million people globally every year. A key defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections is the production of nitric oxide (NO) by macrophages. Although NO controls Mtb growth, it rarely sterilizes the bacterium from the host, suggesting Mtb has mechanisms to resist NO toxicity. The Mtb proteasome is one such mechanism that is required for resistance to NO as well as causing death in mice. Thus, we are interested in targeting the proteasome and its associated factors for drug development. The proteasome is a multi-subunit, barrel shaped complex that degrades proteins. We found that the proteins Mpa and PafA are required for protein degradation: Mpa is thought to chaperone proteins into the proteasome core and PafA appears to be required for the attachment of a prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) onto substrates targeted for destruction. Pup represents the first known post-translational small protein modifier identified in any prokaryote. Little is known about how Pup is conjugated to its target substrates thus we propose to identify and characterize all proteins required for  pupylation  using genetic, biochemical and molecular biological techniques. In addition, we have recently discovered pupylation is reversible, thus we are in the process of characterizing the  depupylation  pathway. The elucidation of the Pup-proteasome sytem of Mtb will hopefully lay the foundation for the discovery and characterization of other posttranslational modification systems in all bacteria. Furthermore, these enzymes may represent new targets for the development of anti- tuberculosis drugs.","2D"
2013,8389667,"5 R01 AI056045-08","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Herpes simplex virus causes human diseases, ranging from cold sores to more serious infections, some of which can be life threatening. Our long term goal has been to delineate the mechanisms that govern HSV entry and HSV induced cell fusion. In contrast to most viruses, HSV utilizes multiple proteins in a multi-step process for fusion and entry. Characterization of these events will likely identify novel paradigms for virus-mediated fusion in general. Four HSV glycoproteins, gD, gB, gH and gL are essential for entry. gD is the receptor binding protein for HSV, while gB and the gH/gL complex form the core fusion machinery for all herpesviruses. Crystal structures of gB, gD and gD bound to its receptors have provided critical insights about how these proteins function in virus entry and cell-fusion. The structural homology of gB with G, the fusion protein of VSV, suggests that gB is a fusion protein in all herpesviruses. Unlike G however, gB does not function on its own but requires gH/gL. Likewise, prior studies showed that gH/gL is a poor fusogen on its own. The prevailing model, based largely on sequence motifs, synthetic peptides and mutations, is that the combination of these two poor fusogens accomplish fusion by acting together in the same membrane (as in virions) to promote fusion. In collaboration with Dr. E. Heldwein, we recently solved the crystal structure of gH/gL. Surprisingly, gH/gL has a novel architecture distinct from any known viral fusion protein, strongly arguing against its role as a fusogen. This structure implies that gB is the only entry protein of HSV that is intrinsically capable of causing fusion. We therefore suggest that gH/gL has a very different role. We postulate that gH/gL functions as a regulator of fusion by binding to gB and activating it into a fusogenic state. In support of this hypothesis, we discovered that the gH/gL ectodomain itself (not membrane bound) can trigger fusion of receptor-bearing cells transfected with gD and gB. In Aim 1, we will dissect the nature of the complex formed by gH/gL with gB with mutants and monoclonal antibodies. Techniques such as biosensor analysis, calorimetry, cryo-EM tomography and X-ray crystallography will be used to gain information about the stoichiometry and conformation of the complex. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiMC) and fusion assays will be used to analyze complex formation when gB and gH/gL are in the same cell (cis) and in different cells (trans). We will determine the ability of mutant forms of gH/gL to trigger gB into a fusogenic state. In Aim 2, we will test gH/gL as a regulator of fusion by varying such parameters as rate and concentration of the WT and mutant forms of soluble gH/gL. We will use BiMC to follow and compare gB-gH/gL complex formation during HSV entry when it occurs by direct fusion at the plasma membrane or by endocytosis. Our work on HSV entry and fusion has strong clinical significance, as each step is a potential target for therapeutics and vaccines against HSV-mediated disease. To test our main hypothesis, we propose two specific aims: 1) to further characterize gH/gL and dissect the nature of the complex it forms with gB; 2) To determine how gH/gL activates gB into a fusogenic state.","2D"

Despite suppressing HIV replication, patients that are unable to sufficiently increase their CD4+ T cell numbers are at significant risk of clinical progression (AIDS-defining event or death). Currently there is a critical need to define the host genes that contribute to CD4+ T cell recovery in order to identify targets for immune modulating therapies. In addition, it is essential to identify biomarkers that can be used to tailor different HAART-regimens to the individual HIV-infected patient in order to maximize CD4+ T cell recovery and increase the utility of existing therapies.  In Aim 1 of this proposal differentially expressed genes between HIV-infected patients (exhibiting complete virological suppression) with a good (DCD4 3200 cells/mm3) versus a poor (DCD4 <200 cells/mm3) outcome after 48 weeks of HAART will be identified using microarrays. We hypothesize that genes contributing to immune recovery will induce CD4+ T cell proliferation and prevent apoptosis and this will be confirmed in vitro by siRNA knockdown and gene over expression analysis. In Aim 2 we will expand upon our preliminary studies that showed gene expression prior to HAART can predict with 100% accuracy which HIV- infected patients progress to good versus poor outcome after 48 weeks of drug treatment. Gene expression classifiers predictive of immune recovery will be constructed exclusively for HIV-infected patients treated with a protease inhibitor (PI)-based HAART regimen, and then for patients treated with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen. Using an innovative approach we will then use the PI-based gene expression classifier to determine if any of the poor outcome patients that were treated with an NNRTI- based regimen were predicted as having a good outcome under a PI-based regimen, and vice versa. In this way we will identify the total number of patients that were placed on the wrong regimen with respect to CD4+ T cell recovery. In the future we will be able to tailor different HAART regimens to the individual patient to increase the extent of immune recovery. In Aim 3 the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in immune recovery will be investigated. We hypothesize that miRNA degradation of mRNA targets represents one mechanism contributing to the differential gene expression between good and poor outcome groups (Aim 3A), and that a combination of miRNA expression with gene expression will result in more accurate classifiers (Aim 3B).  When these studies are complete we will have identified the host genes (i.e. cytokines) that cause immune recovery in HIV-infected patients treated with HAART and may be formulated into immune modulating therapies in the future. We will also have developed gene expression biomarkers capable of guiding the treatment options for HIV-infected patients in order to maximize increases in CD4+ T cell numbers.","2B"

2013,8389842,"5 R01 AI062428-08","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Worldwide, more than 400 million individuals become infected with sexually transmitted infections (STI) every year. Since the transmission of STIs occurs through the genital mucosa, vaccines against STIs must be effective in inducing strong immunity at these susceptible mucosal surfaces. A major cellular effector population that provides protection from a variety of intracellular sexually transmitted pathogens is the CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL). Although the immunological processes involved in the generation and maintenance of systemic memory CTL responses have been studied extensively, the mechanism leading to effective CTL immunity in the cervicovaginal mucosa (CVM) is poorly understood. Several reports indicate that the mere induction of effector CD8+ T cell responses is not sufficient to protect the host from mucosal viral challenge. My laboratory has brought together a variety of approaches and reagents necessary to study inductive, effector and memory CD8+ T cell responses in a physiologically relevant genital STI model. Our research during the first funding period led to the discovery that CTL migration to the CVM requires CD4 T help. Remarkably, we demonstrate in the Preliminary Studies section that even fully helped CTL require CD4 T help in order to enter and remain within the CVM after HSV-2 infection. However, CTL entry into other mucosal organs such as the lung did not require CD4 help, revealing two distinct migration behaviors of CTL - permissive (occurs in the absence of CD4, inflammation or antigen) and restricted (requiring CD4 T cells). We provide new data that demonstrate the critical importance of tissue-resident memory T cells in antiviral protection against genital herpes challenge. Based on these findings, the goal of the proposed study is to examine the anatomical, cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the CD4 T cells enable recruitment and establish effective CD8+ T cell immunity in the female genital mucosa, and to use this knowledge to design vaccine strategies against genital HSV-2 infection. We will accomplish these through 3 distinct but interrelated Aims. In the first Aim, we will determine the homing receptors required for CD4 T cell entry into CVM. In the second Aim, we will determine how local dendritic cells educate naive CD8 T cells to express homing receptor for CVM. In the final Aim, we will utilize the knowledge gained in the previous Aims to design a vaccine strategy that leads to the establishment of local CTL memory pool within the CVM, whereby these cells can recognize and eliminate virally infected cells upon challenge. By providing basic understanding of how CTL gains entry into the genital mucosa, these studies will help to establish critical foundation with which to design immunological interventions and preventative measures against genital herpes and other deleterious STI diseases. Since productive establishment of genital CTL responses is important in defense against many types of sexually transmitted infections, the knowledge gained from the proposed studies will provide critical basic and practical insights for vaccine strategies against STIs in general.","2D"

In addition, the most common route of HIV transmission among AA women is heterosexual exposure. Yet, little research has focused on gender-specific strategies to dissuade heterosexually active AA men from engaging in high HIV/STD transmission risk behaviors. Accordingly, the broad, long-term objective of this research is to develop such strategies. The Specific Aims include testing the efficacy of a theory-based, gender-specific contextually appropriate HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention in increasing consistent condom use, identifying theoretical mediators that account for the intervention's effects, and testing a strategy to increase the longevity of the intervention's effects. This research will utilize a randomized controlled trial design with 360 inner-city AA men 18 to 45 years who report recent unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse with a woman. Men will be randomly allocated to one of two small-group interventions specially designed for AA men: (a) a HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention or (b) a health promotion control intervention on healthful diet and physical activity. To evaluate a strategy to increase the longevity of intervention effects, the men also will be randomized to receive or not receive individually tailored mailings to reinforce the intervention's message. The approach draws on social cognitive theory, the theory of planned behavior, and the applicant's Preliminary Studies with AA men. The primary outcome is self-reported consistent condom use during vaginal and heterosexual anal intercourse in the previous 3 months collected at baseline and 6 and 12 months post-intervention via audio-computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI). Secondary outcomes include other sexual behaviors and theoretical variables hypothesized to mediate intervention efficacy. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) and random effects models will be employed to address the Specific Aims.","5A"
2013,8390461,"5 R01 AI096962-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of which cell types contribute to residual viremia in HAART treated people. Our laboratory's long-range goal is to understand HIV-1 persistence in patients that are optimally treated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). We expect that a greater understanding of HIV persistence will inform the design of therapeutic strategies that will result in long-term remissio or cure. As the next step towards this goal, the objective of this application is to identify celluar sources of residual viremia in optimally treated people and to characterize the residual virus. Our central hypothesis is that residual virus is generated in part by latently infected hematopoietic progenitor cells. The rationale of the proposed work is that identifying cellular reservoirs and viral sub-types that contribute to persistence will yield mechanistic insights into the establishment of latency and accelerate the discovery of disease-modifying therapies. We plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish the objective of this application by pursuing the following four specific aims: (1) Establish the extent to which bone marrow progenitors harbor HIV genomes in optimally treated people on HAART. We hypothesize, based on preliminary studies, that HSPCs are an inducible reservoir of HIV that can spread infection to T cells. We will test this by measuring the amount of reactivatable HIV proviral DNA in HSPCs from a cohort of optimally treated donors on HAART, including donors who have been on HAART since primary HIV infection. (2) Identify which chemokine receptor is primarily utilized by viruses to enter HSPCs. Our working hypothesis, based on preliminary data, is that HSPCs from HAART-treated donors will harbor dual or CXCR4-tropic HIVs. To test this, we will characterize full-length viral envelopes from these cells and use functional assays to assign tropism. (3) Characterize the contribution of infected HSPCs to residual viremia in optimally treated people on HAART. Our preliminary data led us to hypothesize that reactivated virus from infected HSPCs will seed the periphery. To test this, we will isolate and sequence residual virus and determine based on sequence comparisons to what extent HSPCs versus other possible reservoirs can be identified as the cellular source of this virus. (4) We will determine the mechanisms by which quiescent viral DNA in HSPCs can be reactivated to eliminate latently infected cells. Viral latency in HSPCs has not been well characterized. We will examine the cellular and viral factors that contribute to latency in HSPCs to aid in the selection or development of drugs that can purge latently infected HSPCs. This contribution will be significant because identifying the relevant cellular reservoirs and defining the mechanisms of latency is an important initial step toward the development of better treatment strategies for HIV infected people. If our hypothesis is proven correct, this work will refocus efforts to identify therapeutic targets for eradication of cellular reservoirs to long-lived hematopoietic progenitor cells.","2B"
2013,8390462,"5 R01 AI097629-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immune responses to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection in immunocompetent hosts present paradoxes with potentially devastating ramifications for those without immune competency. The long quest for a protective HCMV vaccine has been impeded by multiple factors, including two contradictions about HCMV natural history. (1) HCMV is considered to be a virus with low disease potential in immunocompetent hosts. Yet, the virus efficiently maintains a lifelong persistence in the presence of those immune responses that limit clinical outcomes. A hallmark of HCMV persistence is the reactivation of latent viral genomes and shedding of virus. Horizontal transmission represents an infectious threat to those at-risk for primary HCMV infection, particularly fetuses borne by mothers without prior HCMV immunity. Accumulating evidence highlights another ambiguity about HCMV immunity. (2) The immune responses to HCMV generated during primary and long-term infection, which protect against viral sequelae, are incompletely protective against reinfection with horizontally transmitted virions. It is well- established that women with prior immunity can be reinfected with antigenic variants of HCMV that can then be transmitted to their fetuses. This proposal hypothesizes that there is a key nexus linking virus-host interactions, persistence, and reinfection that is susceptible to vaccine- mediated intervention. Specifically, HCMV modulation of host immunity through the functionality of the HCMV-encoded interleukin-10 protein (cmvIL10), enables both viral reactivation and systemic spread of virions beyond sites of reinfection. HYPOTHESIS: post-exposure increases of neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers to cmvIL10 in HCMV-infected individuals will (1) reduce HCMV shedding and (2) increase resistance to reinfection. This study extends our work on the in vitro functionality of cmvIL10 and the in vivo modulation of host immunity by rhesus CMV (RhCMV)-encoded IL-10 (rhcmvIL10). Aim 1) Quantification of RhCMV shedding in RhCMV- infected monkeys following immunization with functionally inactive rhcmvIL10. Aim 2) Comparison of RhCMV reinfection in RhCMV-immune monkeys that differ in their NAb titers to rhcmvIL10. Aim 3) Characterization of rhcmvIL-10-induced alterations to host immunity.","6D"
2013,8390490,"5 R01 AI033774-19","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cryptococcosis is a major cause of mortality in patients with AIDS, causing over 600,000 deaths per year worldwide. In recent years, cryptococcosis has also emerged as a major problem among organ transplant recipients. The treatment of cryptococcosis is unsatisfactory since the disease is associated with a high morbidity and mortality even following treatment with antifungal drugs. There is an acute need for new approaches to treatment in these populations at risk. Passive antibody therapy is a particularly promising approach. This competing application proposes a research plan to investigate a new problem in immunology, which has direct relevance to the development of antibody therapy for C. neoformans-related diseases, passive antibody therapies in general and our understanding of humoral immunity. In the past funding period, we have established that the constant region (C) domain of an immunoglobulin can affect the specificity of the antibody by a mechanism that is proposed to involve structural changes in the antigen-binding site. This finding challenges the long-held dogma in immunology that viewed immunoglobulin molecules as bifunctional molecules with two independent domains, composed of a C region and a variable (V) region. Our findings challenge this dogma, and in doing so suggest a need for revisions to our views on idiotype regulation, isotype restriction, generation of antibody responses, and generation of diversity in antibody repertories. At a practical level, these findings are critically important for the design and development of chimeric and humanized antibodies for human therapy and impact our analysis of vaccine responses. The research program proposes four aims: 1) To determine the structures and antigen contact residues for V-region identical Fab fragments derived from IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3; 2) To identify the amino acid that mediate isotype-related differences in specificity among Abs with identical V regions; 3) To establish whether constant region-mediated changes in specificity extend to IgM, IgE and IgA isotypes; and 4) Construction of a second-generation mouse-human chimeric Ab suitable for human trials. At the completion of these studies we will know how the C region affects V region conformation to influence affinity, specificity, and idiotype and we will have improved immunoglobulins to C. neoformans glucuronoxylomannan suitable for subsequent clinical studies.","6D"

In vitro, EBV can efficiently transform human primary B-cells in vitro resulting in continual proliferation of the infected primary B-cells into transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). The nascently transformed B-lymphocytes by EBV are strictly latent in that a select set of genes are expressed, one of which is Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA)3C. EBNA3C has been shown to be essential for B cell transformation in vitro by genetic analysis of the virus. Over the last decade the functions associated with EBNA3C has linked this essential molecule to regulation of viral and cellular transcription through interaction with the transcription repressor CSL, Nm23-H1, the tumor suppressor molecule Rb and other cell cycle regulatory factors which include Cyclin A and Cyclin D1.  This proposal will investigate the interactions of the essential EBV nuclear antigen 3C and the cellular factors E2F and c-Myc involved in regulation of cell proliferation, cell cycle, transcription, and signaling involved in maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The specific amino acids of these cellular targets c-Myc and E2F interacting with 3C will be explored and the functional relationships examined in terms of B cell transformation and immortalization. The post-translational modifications of c-Myc and E2F important for activation of their regulatory functions will also be fully investigated. Simultaneously, we will generate site specific recombinant EBNA3C molecules that are knocked out for the specific interactions within the EBV genome to determine their role in primary B cell transformation.","2F"

These disorders are associated with poor medication adherence, risky sexual behavior, and ultimately the  continued spread of HIV/AIDS. Therefore, there is a critical need for effective assessment and treatment of  mental disorders such as major depression and alcohol use disorders particularly among people living with  or at risk for HIV/AIDS. Although major advances in the effective assessment and treatment of psychiatric  and alcohol use disorders have been made, these evidence-based methods are often not adapted and  tested in developing countries such as Kenya. The broad objective of this International Research Scientist  Development Award (IRSDA) is to promote evidence-based assessment and treatment of psychiatric and  alcohol use disorders through a translational approach that is both culturally appropriate and sustainable.  The specific aims of the research plan are to 1) Assess the prevalence of psychiatric and alcohol use  disorders among adults living with HIV/AIDS and adults being tested for HIV at a health clinic located in a  slum community of Nairobi, Kenya, and 2) Implement and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a  culturally relevant, sustainable, mental health referral and alcohol use disorder intervention program for  these adults. The candidate will conduct both qualitative and quantitative tests of the psychometric properties  of all assessment tools and intervention programs to be implemented. Supervised clinical psychology  Masters students will be used for this sustainable treatment model. The long-term objectives of this research  are to help build the capacity of primary care health clinics in underprivileged areas of Kenya such that they  are able to promote mental health care for all their patients and particularly the growing number with alcohol  use disorders. The candidate proposes to implement this research plan during a period of close mentored  training with experts in mental health assessment and treatment in both the United States and Kenya. The  proposed mentored training for the candidate will enable her transition towards independence as an  international mental health epidemiologist.","1A,5A"
2013,8391228,"5 R01 MH056838-17","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 28 years after the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, we are confronting the fact that more than one out of three people with HIV-1 develop some form of HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), even with dramatic reduction of viral load, may reverse some symptoms of HAND (often on a transient basis), but neither cures or prevents the disease. This RO1 has investigated the role of the phospholipid mediator platelet activating factor (PAF) in normal and pathologic synaptic transmission as a key molecule involved in the neuropathogenesis of HAND. In this competing renewal, we hypothesize that viral proteins from HIV-1 can disrupt normal PAF signaling between neuronal synapses by direct and enduring effects on CNS-trafficking immune effector cells that amplify the effects of PAF and cause neurologic disease. Building on data from the previous cycle of this RO1, prolonged exposure or increasing doses of PAF results in a continuum of reversible to irreversible synaptodendritic damage with failure of synaptic transmission due to mitochondrial dysfunction. In this application, we will use in vivo multiphoton microscopy (MPM) to investigate synaptodendritic damage during conditions that model HAND in mouse cortex, using transgenic animals with fluorescently labeled neurons and/or mononuclear phagocytes. We propose three specific aims using HIV-1 Tat and its downstream effector, PAF, to induce changes in immune cell trafficking into the CNS and synaptic communication. In aim 1, we will characterize in vivo PAF-induced dendritic beading that may become irreversible after PAF concentrations exceed thresholds for excitotoxic and neuroinflammatory damage, with the goal of understanding how increasing doses of PAF affect synaptic architecture and function during neuroinflammatory conditions that model HAND. In aim 2, we will use immunodepletion techniques to selectively remove peripheral mononuclear cells or neutrophils prior to stereotactic injection of HIV-1 Tat into the brain, to test whether these cells contribute to synaptodendritic damage by phagocytic engulfment or release of soluble mediators. In aim 3, we will determine the in vivo kinetics of cortical NADH production in response to Tat and PAF, as a measure of tissue oxygenation and energy metabolism; these experiments will test whether synaptodendritic damage occurs due to energy failure in response to increased synaptic activity during neuroinflammation. Together, these aims will help us translate our model of HIV-1 neuropathogenesis to in vivo conditions, bringing us closer to an understanding of how HAND continues to be a problem of major importance to people living with HIV-1.","2G"

Hammer, PI) which will participate in ACTG and HVTN trials; the Harlem Family Center CRS (VV. El-Sadr, PI) which will participate in ACTG trials; the NYBC-Bronx and NYBC-Union Square CRS's (B. Koblin, PI) which will participate in HVTN trials; and the IMPAACT CRS at CUMC (P. LaRussa, PI). Strong community partnerships will be key to the success of the CC-CTU and an in-depth community education and outreach program is in place. Two deeply committed CAB's, one focused on therapy and one focused on prevention, will work with the CTU staff to serve the community by offering clinical trials which are relevant to the challenges that individuals face. Integrating HIV prevention and therapeutic research at the CTU level is an effective model for the rapid translation of study results into improvements in care and public health.

2013,8391249,"5 UM1 AI069529-07","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical research, much of it sponsored by NIAID, has markedly improved survival of patients with HIV/AIDS. However, the epidemic continues to grow both in both developed and the developing world. In the U.S., minority groups, especially African-Americans, are disproportionately affected throughout the country. Nationally, African-Americans make up 40% of AIDS cases but only 12.3% of the U.S. population. This disparity is even greater among children and adolescents (ages 13 to 19 years), among whom African Americans make up 60% of AIDS cases but only 15% of the U.S. population. In Memphis, approximately 46% of the population is African-Americans but 90% of the HIV and AIDS cases occur n African-Americans. In addition, data from the CDC show that cumulatively, 36% of all reported AIDS cases have been in the South, but the South accounted for 45% of new AIDS cases in 2003. These data confirm the disproportionate growth of the epidemic in this region. Because of the evolving epidemiology of HIV infection in the U.S., Memphis is an ideal location for a domestic HIV/AIDS Clinical Trial Unit (CTU). Memphis is a large Southern urban area that provides tertiary health care for individuals in an approximately 200-mile radius in the states of Tennessee, Mississippi, Missouri, and Arkansas. This area has been identified as one of the poorest in the nation. Here, the proposed CTU, located at: St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, will provide clinical trial access for to underrepresented populations that are most severely affected by the epidemic;, including women, adolescents, and African-Americans. The proposed CTU is currently a Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group Unit and is affiliated with the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Group. The unit will have a single site located at St. Jude with a consortium agreement with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. The unit will address all four scientific aims of IMPAACT: Prevention of Maternal to Child Transmission of HIV; Translational Research/Drug Development; Optimization of Clinical Management including Co- Morbidities; and Vaccine Research and Development. Based on the availability of severely affected populations, the experienced staff, and the strong history of clinical trial conduct and scientific contributions to the PACTG, the St Jude CTU will be a valued domestic unit for IMPAACT.

There are many important unresolved management issues including the optimal antiretroviral treatment strategy at different stages of HIV disease, treatment of co-morbidities and minimizing of drug-associated toxicities. The University of Cincinnati AIDS Clinical Trials Unit (UC ACTU) has been an NIAID-funded AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) site since 1987. In this application the UC ACTU proposes to establish a Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) and Clinical Research Site (CRS) affiliated with the ACTG leadership application.  This highly-experienced CTU, which was 5th in overall accrual and 3rd in cost per weighted accrual among 34 main ACTG units over the last 3 years, will continue to build upon its exemplary performance, scientific and resource committee contributions to provide leadership within a world-class clinical trials network (ACTG) with the scientific goals of developing new therapeutic approaches (translational research/drug development); optimizing clinical management including toxicities and co-morbidities; preventing maternal-child transmission; and vaccine research and development. To accomplish the goals of the ACTG the UC ACTU will: 1) Establish an administrative core CTU including a principal investigator, clinical trials manager, regulatory manager, data/Quality assurance manager, staff training and education, specimen processing, community outreach and administrative support to provide oversight, coordination and scientific expertise required to operate a high-performing CTU that will interface with the overall agenda/work of the ACTG; 2) Contribute to the ACTG scientific agenda by enrolling subjects in studies, generating new proposals participating in study teams and committees to advance the work of the group; 3) Establish a CRS that can maintain 20 subjects on study per month with the capability of following 100 subjects annually focusing enrollment on under-represented populations and utilizing the highest standards of good clinical practice for clinical research units. Thus, the UC ACTU, led by Dr. Judith Feinberg, an experienced HIV clinical researcher with support from leading experts in the fields of hepatitis (Dr. Ken Sherman) and HIV associated dyslipidemia/ cardiovascular disease (Dr. Carl Fichtenbaum), will contribute to the improvement in the lives of those with HIV infection through its excellence in clinical research.

Clinical trials will be designed and implemented: 1) to optimize the clinical management of HIV and its related complications; 2) to evaluate agents with novel mechanisms of action or improved toxicity profiles for the treatment of HIV and/or for major copathogens (such as tuberculosis and hepatitis); 3) to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of multiple candidate HIV vaccines and adjuvants; 4) to develop means of reducing HIV transmission by integrating HIV treatment with prevention efforts that evaluate practical behavioral interventions and other methods of transmission interruption; and 5) to minimize the risk of vertical transmission by maximizing care of HIV-infected women during their child-bearing years. HIV-infected individuals from a wide spectrum of ages, communities and socio-economic conditions will be recruited, screened and enrolled in specific protocols that address these high priority research areas at the OSU ACTU. Coordination of research related activities and timely execution of new studies will take advantage of established investigator expertise, ongoing productive partnerships with scientist colleagues and the HIV-infected community and a clinical research infrastructure that is recognized for its productivity in the ACTG over the past 18 years and more recently in large scale vaccine and prevention trials. Experienced research staff (investigators, nurses, pharmacy, data management, laboratory and outreach personnel) will recruit, screen, enroll and rummage all essential and required elements of clinical trials participation. Clinical research that develops and tests strategies and new treatments for HIV infection and its complications is critically important for controlling HIV disease progression and minimizing side effects. Well-designed clinical trials to test vaccines and other preventive strategies are essential to preventing the spread of HIV infection.      ADMINISTRATIVE COMPONENT:","6B,6C,6D,6J"
2013,8391260,"5 R01 AI037113-16","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chemokines and their receptor are best known for their role in immune surveillance, where they control the migration and activation of leukocytes to resolve physiological abnormalities such as infection and cancer. However, inappropriate regulation of these proteins is associated with an extraordinary number of pathologies including inflammatory disease, atherosclerosis, cancer and AIDS. Thus there is significant interest in understanding how they function in order to develop drugs to block their activities. In recent years, it has become clear that chemokine-induced cell migration is a complex multistep process involving many different interactions, not only of chemokines with chemokine receptors, but also with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and with each other through homo- and hetero-oligomerization. GAGs are structurally diverse linear carbohydrates that are often attached to membrane bound protein anchors as proteoglycans. These interactions are involved in locally sequestering chemokines on cell surfaces, preventing diffusion so that chemokines provide directional cues for migrating cells. Other roles for chemokine:GAG interactions include transport across cells, regulation of oligomerization with as yet poorly characterized signaling consequences, and regulation of receptor binding and activation. Since GAG structures are highly diverse, interactions with chemokines may significantly contribute to the specificity and fine tuning of cell migration, well beyond the chemokine:receptor interaction. However, at present, there is little structural information about chemokine:GAG complexes and their precise functional consequences. An overarching hypothesis of this proposal, is that structural plasticity through oligomerization of chemokines on GAGs, or GAG-induced folding of unstructured domains, are mechanisms of functional specificity/diversity, and that through changes in oligomerization or unfolded state structure, a given chemokine may recognize different GAGs. A second hypothesis is that some chemokines dynamically change their structures through homo- and hetero-oligomerization which may control other steps in cell migration in addition to immobilization on GAGs. Aim 1 involves structural studies of chemokine:GAG complexes to (i) identify GAGs that preferentially recognize specific chemokines and determine the level of specificity; (ii) characterize binding affinities and interaction mechanisms (e.g. oligomerization or folding of unstructured domains); and (iii) determine trans-scale structural information of complexes from small oligomers through larger oligomeric assemblies on flexible GAGs. To complement these studies, in Aim 2, structural information will be correlated with function to probe how dynamic changes in chemokine oligomerization and GAG interactions coordinate discrete sequential steps of cell migration: (i) transcytosis and cell surface presentation on GAGs, (ii) leukocyte arrest (iii) transmigration, and (iv) activation of cellular defense responses. Together these studies will provide novel insight into the regulation of chemokine function through GAG- binding and oligomerization, where structural plasticity is likely to play a significant role.","2C"
2013,8391261,"5 R01 AI085043-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistent viral infections are a worldwide health concern, with over 500 million people infected with HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV). By definition, immune escape is required for viral persistence; however the suppressive mechanisms that abort immunity during persistent viral infections are not well defined. T cell responses are crucial to prevent and control viral infections. Although robust T cell responses are initially mounted to these viruses, T cells rapidly lose activity permitting persistence. Recent evidence suggests that the functionally non-responsive T cell state (exhaustion) is not programmed during T cell activation, but that T cell responses are actively suppressed throughout infection. We discovered that infection with a persistent strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) triggers high IL-10 production that directly ablates T cell function and causes viral persistence. Antibody blockade of IL-10 restored T cell activity and purged the persistent infection, indicating that host regulatory mechanisms actually permit viral persistence and are actively responsible for preventing clearance. This research suggests the exciting prospect that, when freed, T cells are capable of controlling persistent viruses. A better understanding of how immunosuppressive factors inhibit immunity is critical for the design of therapies to re-establish immune control and prevent and potentially eradicate persistent viral infections. In the current proposal I will define the mechanisms leading to IL-10 mediated immunosuppression during persistent viral infection. I will utilize cutting- edge microscopy techniques to directly visualize immunosuppressive cells in vivo and the specific interactions that suppress T cell function and sustain T cell exhaustion. These studies will provide the first in vivo mechanistic insights into how host molecules cause immunosuppression during persistent viral infection. I will then test a novel strategy to enhance T cell immunity and purge a long- lived reservoir of viral replication from an immune privileged site. Once completed this effort will have a direct impact toward our understanding of host-virus interactions, the mechanisms employed to promote viral clearance versus persistence and therapeutically the ability to restore immune function to completely eliminate persistent infection.","2C"

During this time Stanford investigators have served in man> different leadership capacities within the ACTG and have made significant contributions to the treatment of HIV infection through these efforts. Our CTU investigators and staff are now poised to build on this record cf scientific contribution within the context of the restructured clinical trials network. The Stanford CTU focuses primarily on the development, evaluation and optimization of combination antiretroviral drug therapy (ART) for the treatment and long-term management of HIV-1 infection including the use of novel agents and technologies for monitoring treatment efficacy. Our group has a particular interest in the basic mechanisms and clinical implications of drug resistance in HIV-1. The Stanford VSL is focused on drug resistance and subtype diversity of non-clade B isolates and has been designated as the drug resistance reference testing laboratory in the International-ACTG and ACTG network application. In addition, the Stanford group has developed a database which links HIV treatment histories and treatment outcomes to genotypic and phenotypic drug resistance patterns. Advanced informatics databases that manage  high-dimensional  data- like drug resistance data and pharmacogenomics data will likely become increasingly important resources for our understanding of the determinates of health and disease, response to treatment and risk of drug toxicities as we move forward in the next 5-10 years. The Stanford CTU comprises three Clinical Research sites with ethnically and socially diverse patient populations: (i) Stanford University's Positive Care Clinic in Palo Alto, (ii) The PACE Clinic at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in central San Jose, and (iii) The Edison Clinic, run by the San Mateo County AIDS Program at San Mateo Medical Center. Through this constellation of sites we have always exceeded our community-based targets for under represented ethnic groups and women in ACTG trial enrollment. Although this working arrangement has been successful for over 10 years, further consolidations and streamlining described here will ensure that the proposed CTU and CRSs will be even more efficient.

2013,8391697,"5 R01 GM052072-17","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Retroviruses and long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons comprise a family of mobile elements that encode reverse transcriptase and copy their RNA genome into a cDNA that is integrated into the host genome. These prolific genomic parasites constitute a significant fraction of virtually all eukaryotic genomes. Their success as parasites relies on an array of host functions, since retroviruses and retrotransposons have small genomes and complex modes of replication. Host factors that are required for retroelement replication are potential targets for small molecules to treat AIDS, yet few have been characterized thus far.  The family of active Ty1 LTR-retrotransposons in the yeast, S. cerevisiae, provides a unique model system to explore the eukaryotic host-retrotransposon relationship. Using a synthetic genetic array screen and secondary molecular screens, my lab has identified 48 retrotransposition host factors (RHFs) that are required for accumulation of Ty1 cDNA. Many of these RHFs are global regulators of translation and mRNA localization and turnover, including ribosomal protein paralogs, ribosome biogenesis factors, a paralog of translation initiation factor eIF4G, nonsense-mediated decay proteins Upf1-Upf3, the activator of decapping, Dhh1, the decapping holoenzyme, Dcp1/Dcp2 and the 5' to 3' exoribonuclease, Xrn1.  The RNA genome of Ty1, like that of retroviruses, functions as a template for both translation of virus- like particle (VLP) proteins and for reverse transcription within VLPs. We have recently found that eIF4G1 and two ribosomal protein paralogs are required for accumulation of TyA, the major capsid protein, while Xrn1 influences Ty1 RNA packaging into VLPs. Moreover, we have found that Ty1 RNA is translationally repressed in sucrose-dense ribonucleoprotein particles and that TyA is associated with cytoplasmic mRNA processing bodies (P bodies), where translational regulators and mRNA decay factors are concentrated. We propose to examine the mechanism of translational regulation of Ty1 RNA and determine whether this regulation plays a role in partitioning Ty1 RNA between translation and packaging in VLPs. In addition, we will examine the role of mRNA decay proteins in the formation of VLPs that are functional for reverse transcription. The specific aims are: (1) to identify the steps in retrotransposition that are blocked in rhf mutants with reduced levels of Ty1 cDNA; (2) to examine the role of ribosomal protein paralogs, ribosome biogenesis factors and eIF4G1 in the translational regulation and localization of Ty1 RNA and protein; and, (3) to characterize Ty1 RNPs and determine whether mRNA decay factors influence Ty1 RNA or protein localization, RNA packaging in VLPs and/or reverse transcription. This project will elucidate specific mechanisms by which eukaryotic host factors promote the replication of retrotransposons and retroviruses.","6A"

The UCSD CTU is affiliated, by invitation, with the proposed ACTG and HPTN Leadership Group applications. The ACTG CRS will conduct therapeutic clinical trials developed by the ACTG, targeting HIV-1-infected adult and older adolescent patients recruited from the San Diego County area, concentrating on studies in the high priority areas of translational research, new antiretroviral drug development, optimizing antiretroviral therapy and the clinical management of HIV-1 disease and its complications and co-infections, pathogenesis and treatment of acute HIV-1 infection and drug resistant HIV-1, and the evaluation of candidate HIV-1 vaccines as immunotherapeutic agents in individuals with chronic established HIV-1 infection. The HPTN CRS will conduct clinical trials developed by the HPTN, targeting predominantly HIV-uninfected but high-risk participants drawn from the San Diego County area, as well as HIV-1-infected patients participating in ACTG therapeutic clinical trials ( prevention for positives  initiatives) in collaboration with the ACTG. The HPTN CRS will concentrate on studies of antiretroviral treatment of acute HIV-1 infection to reduce transmission in this high-risk population, and of behavioral interventions to reduce transmission of HIV-1 and sexually transmitted infections in both HIV-uninfected and chronically infected individuals and their sexual partners. The CTU will initially devote 75% of its research effort on clinical trials implemented by the ACTG and 25% effort on clinical trials conducted through the HPTN, in order to accommodate the large complement of research participants continuing in ACTG studies through the transition period in year 1. These proportions will shift over time as new protocols are implemented and ongoing protocols are completed. Both CRSs will contribute scientifically to each Network through new investigator-initiated studies proposed in the new grant period in these research priority areas, and will further contribute to Network administrative and scientific leadership for both the ACTG and HPTN. The outcome of the proposed research will contribute substantially to halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and to improving the lives of those already infected with HIV-1.

2013,8392972,"7 R01 AI091476-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Soluble forms of the HIV-1 receptor CD4 have been studied as potential therapeutics for a number of years. Soluble CD4 (sCD4), and the more bioavailable fusion protein, CD4-Ig, neutralize more broadly than any neutralizing antibody, and, unlike antibodies, they can irreversibly inactivate the envelope glycoprotein trimer. Nonetheless, several problems with CD4-Ig limit its therapeutic use. First, the affinity of CD4 for the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein is lower than that of efficient neutralizing antibodies. Second, CD4-Ig, like sCD4, enhances HIV-1 infection at low concentrations, a serious difficulty as local concentrations vary in vivo. This enhancement occurs because CD4-Ig bound at low valency promotes association of the envelope glycoprotein with the cellular coreceptor, CCR5 or CXCR4. Third, low concentration enhancement permits sufficient residual viral replication in the presence of CD4-Ig to enable viral escape. Finally, there remains the practical problem of using a protein therapeutic like CD4-Ig in resource-poor settings. The first goal of this proposal is to further develop a more effective form of CD4-Ig. Our key observation is that by adding a short peptide mimetic of CCR5, we substantially increase the affinity of CD4-Ig for the envelope glycoprotein while preventing the enhancement of infection observed with unmodified CD4-Ig. We hypothesize that this enhanced CD4-Ig ( eCD4-Ig ) will impose a significantly higher fitness cost on escaping virus than does unmodified CD4-Ig or neutralizing antibodies. Our second goal is to build on recent advances in gene delivery using self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV) vectors. Increasingly these vectors are recognized as a safe, unobtrusive way to maintain high levels of protein therapeutics in vivo. For example, a single intramuscular injection with scAAV-vector expressing an scFv immunoadhesin or CD4-Ig can sustain high serum protein levels for more than two years and protect a macaque from an SIV challenge. We hypothesize that, if key hurdles can be overcome, scAAV-delivered protein inhibitors like eCD4-Ig could be used to drive down viral loads to the point where transmission is unlikely. However, these hurdles are substantial. First, immune clearance of scAAV-delivered scFv-Ig and CD4-Ig is a frequent and formidable problem in healthy, uninfected macaques, although perhaps less of a concern in late-stage infections. A second major problem is that of viral escape, a much greater concern with therapeutic applications of scAAV than with prophylactic ones. We will address both of these issues as we compare the efficacy of scAAV-delivered CD4-Ig and eCD4-Ig in a macaque model of infection. These studies will therefore (1) evaluate the use scAAV-delivered protein inhibitors in infected individuals while (2) developing a novel therapeutic with important advantages over neutralizing antibodies and unmodified CD4-Ig.","6A"
2013,8393063,"5 R01 MH085608-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) is detected early in central nervous system (CNS) and causes neuroinflammation leading to the initiation and expansion of neuronal injury and death. In USA alone, 40% of about 1 million HIV-1 infected individuals are likely to acquire HIV-1 related CNS impairment. The innate immune mechanisms underlying HIV-1 neuropathogenesis and CNS impairment have been understudied. Mannose binding lectin (MBL), coded by MBL2 gene, is an active phase protein that mounts innate immune response against risk of infections by recognizing mannose residues present on the surface of pathogens (e.g. viruses, bacteria) and initiating the complement pathway by activating MBL- associated serine proteases (MASPs). MBL binds to high mannose N-linked glycan residues of HIV-1 gp41/120 and elicits cytokine responses and macrophage mediated HIV-1 opsonization. Thus, lower MBL expression or function can result in neuroinflammation and anomalous accumulation of viral proteins and immune complexes in brain leading to neurotoxicity and neurocognitive impairment. Recently, in about 1000 HIV-1 infected children we showed that the presence of MBL2 genetic variants resulting in expression of non-functional MBL was associated with more rapid progression of CNS impairment. Although effects of MBL2 variants on susceptibility of HIV-1 and disease progression are known; their association with the progression of CNS impairment is a new finding. The proposed research seeks to extend this new finding by studying the association of MBL expression and function to the susceptibility and progression of HIV-1 related neuroinflammation and CNS impairment. Our overarching hypothesis is that lower expression and altered function of MBL impairs MBL-mediated complement activation, related cytokine responses; scavenger opsonization function and leads to increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and neuroinflammation, accumulation of viral/complement proteins or autoantigens in brain, and eventually neurocognitive impairment. Additionally, variant MBL2/MASP-2 alleles alter expression and function of MBL in CNS. For these studies, we will determine the MBL, MASPs and complement protein levels in paired CSF/plasma from HIV infected impaired/unimpaired adults (N=2385) from HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center (HNRC, UCSD); and post-mortem brain tissues (N=45) from National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC, Rockville, MD) using highly sensitive multiplex ELISAs, innate immune response microarray analyses during HIV infection, quantitative PCR validation, genotyping, immunohistostaining and fluorescence microscopy techniques. These studies will help to understand the novel role of MBL and related innate immunity complement biomarkers in HIV related neuroinflammation and neurocognitive impairment; and might suggest avenues for development of effective therapeutics such as recombinant human MBL.","2G"

This provides him a solid foundation for biomedical research, but to develop as an independent investigator in neuroscience he requires training in basic neuroscience and practical aspects of performing animal studies. Dr. Liu has assembled a strong mentor and collaborator team with an excellent track record in MRI, neuroscience and image processing research. His primary mentor, Dr. Michael Boska is a leading expert in MRI and MRS. His co-mentor, Dr. Howard Gendelman is an international authority in neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, Dr. Liu will take graduate level courses in neuroscience provided in UNMC. The research project addresses an imperative need in NeuroAIDS research as detailed below. This project will provide training for Dr. Liu in 1) murine brain anatomy and physiology, 2) generation of disease models in mice including irradiation, human cell engraftment, cell acquisition, cultivation, infection and animal surgery, 3) immunohistochemical processing and analysis including, but not limited to slicing, staining and quantification of histopathological staining used for interpretation of results. Dr. Liu will submit a R01 to the NIH by the end of Year 3 of the award focused on the study of neurodegenerative diseases using advanced imaging technologies. His long term career goal is to become an independent investigator in neuroscience. HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) occurs in the late stage HIV-1 infection and manifests with varying degrees of clinical cognitive, behavioral and motor abnormalities. These range from mild motor/cognitive deficits to overt dementia (HIV-1 associated dementia, HAD). With antiretroviral therapy the cumulative incidence is 25-38% and the prevalence is around 37%. Milder forms affect an additional 30-40% of patients. The chronic and fluctuating forms of HIV dementia are more common. The pathological correlate of HAD is HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE). The presence of activated microglia and brain macrophages with lower levels of virus is a central pathological feature of disease. Tests that can clearly distinguish HAND from other diseases of the nervous system that occur during progressive HIV-1 infection are needed for definitive diagnosis, disease progression tracking and therapeutic monitoring. Murine models of HIVE and HAND have been developed at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The objective of this proposal is to develop in-vivo manganese enhanced 3D multispectral magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) that will serve as a biomarker for HAND. In vivo manganese enhanced multispectral MRM (MEmMRM) and MRM data analysis techniques will be developed to determine the time course of neuronal loss, macrophage/microglial activation and astrocytosis in the murine HIVE and HAND models. MEmMRM results in diseased mice will be confirmed with controls and histopathological analysis.","2G"
2013,8393501,"5 R01 HD068174-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria and HIV infection are two of the most important health challenges of our time. Children under 5 years of age and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to the complicating effects of malaria and HIV co- infection. Treatment options within Africa have improved, with increasing availability of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for malaria and expanded access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV. ACTs are critical for treatment of malaria due to widespread resistance to older drugs. ACTs exhibit complex pharmacology, undergo activation and/or metabolism via cytochrome p450 pathways and are susceptible to physiological differences and drug-drug interactions with ARTs. However, treatment guidelines have largely stemmed from adult studies, and have ignored the impact of age or pregnancy on drug disposition. Mounting evidence, including studies from our group, indicates that ACTs may be underdosed in children or pregnant women, and are associated with significant drug interactions and heightened toxicities, in particular neutropenia, in the setting of HIV infection and concomitant ART. Proper dosing is critical to improve treatment efficacy and minimize risk of drug resistance and toxicity. NIH-funded trials comparing ART-based treatment strategies for reducing malaria morbidity in HIV-infected children and pregnant women (PROMOTE) are currently underway in Tororo, Uganda, a region with high rates of malaria transmission and HIV infection. This proposal will complement PROMOTE and investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of artemether-lumefantrine (AL), the most widely adopted ACT, in the context of ART, to optimize treatment for malaria and HIV. The specific aims are 1) To evaluate the impact of ART and age on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in HIV-infected children; 2) To evaluate the impact of ART and pregnancy on the PK and PD of artemether-lumefantrine in HIV-infected pregnant women; 3) To determine if ART and AL exposure following standard dosing is predictive of neutropenia in children and pregnant women with HIV and malaria co-infection. HIV-infected children and pregnant women, treated with either protease inhibitor (PI) or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART will be co- enrolled from PROMOTE, and undergo intensive PK evaluations for AL during treatment for malaria. PI-based regimens include lopinavir/ritonavir, and NNRTI-based regimens include either nevirapine or efavirenz. Results will be compared to intensive PK evaluations in HIV-uninfected children also residing in Tororo. To assess associations between drug exposure and clinical outcomes, longitudinal population PK/PD studies will determine if changes in AL exposure impact malaria treatment efficacy, and if AL and ART exposure correlates with high rates of neutropenia observed in HIV and malaria co-infected individuals. The proposed pharmacology studies will inform future dosing guidelines for the most widely adopted ACT and ART regimens in Africa.","6D"
2013,8396374,"5 R01 AI098472-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our group has pioneered the use of small hair samples to monitor adherence to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy  in HIV infection.  We have demonstrated that hair concentrations of ARVs, which monitor long-term exposure,  are stronger predictors of treatment success than self-reported adherence or plasma ARV levels in large  cohorts of HIV-infected patients.  Moreover, we have shown high sensitivity and specificity for tenofovir (TFV)  detection in hair in a PrEP trial and have demonstrated a strong correlation between TFV dosing and TFV  concentrations in hair.  Recent data from HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) trials and prevention of mother  to child transmission (PMTCT) settings indicate that adherence to prophylactic ARVs when assessed by more  objective biomarkers of adherence (e.g. drug levels in plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs),  breast milk, cord blood) is not always concordant with self report or other more traditional adherence  measures, such as pill counts.  Hair specimens are easy to collect, store and analyze, providing substantial  feasibility, safety and accuracy advantages over other objective methods to monitor adherence, especially in  resource-limited settings.  This proposal seeks to extend our approach of using hair ARV levels to monitor  adherence from the HIV treatment to the prevention setting, partnering with two large, ongoing NIH-funded  global HIV prevention trials to further test our methodology in a cost-effective manner.   Aim 1 adds hair measures for TFV and emtricitabine (FTC) adherence monitoring into the active oral arms of  VOICE (Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic), an ongoing MTN-sponsored PrEP trial in  African women to assess the effectiveness and safety of oral TFV-based products or vaginal TFV gel in  preventing HIV acquisition.  Aim 2 adds hair measures for nevirapine (NVP) monitoring into the daily infant  NVP prophylaxis arm of PROMISE BF (Promoting Maternal and Infant Survival Everywhere), a recently- launched IMPAACT-sponsored PMTCT trial in breastfeeding (BF) infants.  We will analyze the relevant  prophylactic ARV level(s) in hair in each trial once outcomes are available and analyze these hair levels as  predictors for HIV seroconversion (aims 1A, 2A) and ARV toxicity (aims 1B, 2B) in multivariate models,  comparing hair levels to self-report, pill counts and plasma ARV levels.  We will also monitor hair TFV levels  in women receiving vaginal TFV gel product to assess for systemic absorption (aim 1C) in VOICE and assess  correlations between hair and breast milk ARV levels in the pharmacology sub-study of PROMISE BF (aim  2C).  Finally, for Aim 3, we will develop a low-cost point-of care testing method to analyze ARV levels in hair  and compare this assay to our validated and sensitive method using liquid chromatography/tandem mass  spectrometry.  At study completion, we expect to have validated hair levels of ARVs as a novel and practical  biomarker of adherence which can easily be implemented into public health programs geared towards HIV  prevention and prevention of maternal to child transmission.","1C"
2013,8396377,"5 R01 AI094745-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to characterize the mechanisms by which B cells contribute to the development of optimal anti-tuberculosis (TB) immunity. The importance of T cell immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has been well established. The role of B cells in TB is not clearly defined. We and others have shown that B cells are a significant component of lung tuberculous granulomas in human and mice. They form conspicuous aggregates with features of germinal center B cells. Using the B cell-deficient mMT mouse, in conjunction with B cell transfer studies, we showed that B cells contribute significantly to anti-Mtb responses and are required for the optimal control of TB. Mice deficient in the inhibitory Fcg receptor IIB (FcgRIIB), relative to wildtype (WT) animals, exhibit an enhanced Th1 response in acute TB. The CD4+ T cells response of mMT mice is also altered in chronic infection. Together, these results provide strong evidence that B cells can regulate T cell immunity in TB, perhaps in part via FcgR engagement with antigen (Ag)-antibody (Ab) complex. We recently observed that BCG vaccination induces a Th1 response in mMT mice that is inferior to that observed in WT's. A recent study reports on the inability of BCG to optimally protect the CBA/xid mouse, another B cell-deficient strain. These BCG studies, together with published data that B cells can regulate T cell memory and secondary response to pathogen challenge, suggests that B cells contribute to vaccine efficacy. To stringently test the significance of B cells in regulating host immunity against Mtb, we initiated studies to examine the B cell response in a cynomolgus macaque (non-human primate; NHP) model, one that arguably most genuinely represents the human system. This study revealed that in the lungs of tuberculous NHP, as in human and mice, B cells can form discreet nodules and display enhanced expression of activation markers. We propose to use both murine and NHP TB models to rigorously test the hypotheses that: i) Specific functions of B cells contribute significantly to the host immune response to Mtb; ii) B cells are required for the development of effective T cell response in TB, including the CD4 T cell memory response; iii) B cells are essential for the development of optimal vaccine-engendered protection; and iv) Ag-Ab complex and FcgR can be exploited to enhance the host immune response to Mtb. We believe the proposed studies can shed light on the mechanisms by which B cells shape the host immune response to Mtb and lead to novel measures for harnessing humoral immunity to augment anti-TB immunity.","2D"

The number of new HIV infections due to sexual assault is unknown, but young women, especially of color, are among the fastest growing groups contracting HIV. Sexual assault affects both men and women. Sexual assault presents several factors making transmission of HIV more likely such as: lack of condom use; infliction of genital and/or anal trauma; concurrent sexually transmitted infections (STIs); and multiple and/or unknown assailants. Non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) for sexual assault remains controversial in the US. However, nPEP is recommended as standard practice internationally, especially in areas of high sexual assault with greater rates of HIV such as in South Africa. The proposed mixed methods study will address the following specific aims, hypotheses and research questions: Aim 1: To compare the frequency and factors related to offering nPEP to sexual assault patients by Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANE) in urban settings. Aim 2: To identify predictors of acceptance and adherence to nPEP post- sexual assault. Hypothesis 2.1: Survivors with depression and/or trauma symptoms will be less likely to complete nPEP than those with lower levels of these symptoms. Research Question: Does intention mediate the relationship between cognitive/personal factors and the behavior - completion of nPEP?

The EBV genome persists in all latently infected cells as a non-integrated multi-copy episome. The persistence of EBV episomes in dividing cells is dependent on the EBV encoded nuclear antigen 1 protein (EBNA1). EBNA1 binds to a specific site in the EBV episome and enhances episome initial replication, transcription, and persistence. Since EBNA1 is essential for the persistence of EBV episomes in all dividing and malignant cells, the central objective of this proposal is to identify compounds that can inhibit EBNA1 mediated episome persistence. To achieve that objective, we propose to: (1) Undertake screens to identify compounds that interrupt EBNA1-oriP dependent episome transcription and persistence in vivo, compounds that interrupt EBNA1 dimerization and binding to cognate DNA in vitro, and compounds that bind to EBNA1 in silico. (2) Identify the biological and biochemical effects of the identified compounds on EBNA1-oriP dependent episome transcription and persistence in B lymphoblasts, on EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cell (LCL) growth, and on LCL induced Lymphoma and NPC tumors in nude mice. (3) Determine the sites of bioactive compound effects in EBNA1 binding, using biochemical, biophysical, and structural approaches. Use this knowledge to most effectively undertake structure activity modifications to improve compound activity and specificity. (4) Use reverse genetics to identify the critical residues in EBNA1 DBD that can improve screening sensitivity and inform in silico pocket selection, compound modification, and compound interaction analyses.","6H"
2013,8400900,"5 K01 MH093205-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This mentored research project will investigate an under-researched aspect of HIV in Africa: the HIV prevention needs of female migrants. Migration and HIV research has almost exclusively focused on HIV risks to male migrants, often failing to measure the risks to women via their involvement in migration. Yet across the region, women's levels of participation in migration have met or exceeded those of men. Moreover, the few studies which have examined HIV risks to female migrants found higher risk behavior and HIV prevalence in migrant compared to non-migrant women. My dissertation study found that migration was associated with a higher risk of HIV infection in women than in men in South Africa. The finding warrants confirmation in East Africa, where HIV/AIDS is devastating communities and the sex disparity in infection risk is striking. HIV prevalence levels in Nyanza Province, Kenya are among the highest in Africa. Previous studies have found high levels of participation in migration by both men and women in Kenya and higher sexual risk behaviors among migrants than non-migrants. However, little is known about the mechanisms through which participation in migration leads to higher risk behavior in women. My proposed plan will address this gap. It is comprised of two phases: a secondary data analysis, and an in-depth qualitative study in Kenya. These two 'modules' will address the following aims: (1) Assess the degree to which HIV infection in women in Kenya is influenced by their participation in migration, and identify explanatory mechanisms by which women's migration may increase their HIV risks. I will use secondary data from Kenya Demographic and Health and AIDS Indicator Surveys and demographic surveillance field sites to carry out analyses to achieve this aim. Using 'HIV Triangulation', I will evaluate these findings along with information from other sources in participatory workshops with local stakeholders in Kenya. This exercise will inform the design of the qualitative study to be carried out in Aim 2: (2) Characterize social and psychological aspects of women's migration experience in Nyanza Province, Kenya which facilitate their risks of acquiring and transmitting HIV infection. I will use participant observation and in-depth interviews to characterize the spatial and social features of the common destinations of female migrants, and identify the structural and psychological aspects of women's migration that influence their HIV infection risks. These antecedents to HIV infection in female migrants serve as potential points of HIV prevention intervention, thus laying the groundwork for Aim 3: (3) Develop a preliminary plan for a multi-level HIV prevention intervention with female migrants in Nyanza. In participatory workshops with local stakeholders, I will critically evaluate the cumulative findings of this research, identify potential points of intervention with female migrants, assess acceptability of various options, and develop a preliminary intervention plan. At the start of year 4 I will submit an R34 application to the NIMH for a formative study to develop and assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.","5A"
2013,8401015,"5 F32 MH094210-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Monocytes, macrophages, and microglia are mononuclear phagocytes important in innate immunity, but also key reservoirs of HIV in the central nervous system. These reservoirs represent a challenge to HIV-1 eradication since they remain producing virus in tissue despite the presence of antiretroviral therapy. Cystatin B expression is positively correlated with HIV replication and decreased levels STAT-1 phosphorylation (STAT-1PY) in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). However, the players and the mechanism by which this occurs are unknown. This work is expected to elucidate the mechanism by which cystatin B contributes to HIV-1 replication by regulation of STAT-1PY in macrophage reservoirs. The objective of in this particular application is to define the relationships and signaling pathways between cystatin B, STAT-1PY, interferon (IFN), and HIV persistence in MDM. To attain the objective of this proposal, we will test hypothesis that cystatin B promotes HIV persistence by interacting with the STAT-1PY and additional proteins, including those related to IFN signaling pathway. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data produced in the applicants' laboratories. The rationale of the proposed research is that understanding the role of cystatin B in HIV replication will permit the modulation of this protein or its interacting proteins and decrease HIV within macrophage reservoirs. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Define the cystatin B/STAT-1 signaling pathways and proteins associated to STAT-1 phosphorylation and HIV replication in macrophages; and 2) Identify the role of Cystatin B in the JAK/STAT-1 pathway during HIV infection and IFN-2 activation. Under the first aim we will use In situ Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) (Olink Biosciences) to confirm, localize and quantify this protein interaction in uninfected and HIV infected MDM and determine if cystatin B interacts directly or indirectly with STAT-1. We will also identify the specific protein pathways associated to cystatin that are subject to modification by phosphorylation using spectral counting based quantification. Under the second aim, we will determine the effect of cystatin B in LTR mediated HIV replication and IFN induced antiviral response using the luciferase assay and correlate our findings with what happens in the MDM. This approach is innovative because, the role of cystatin B as a regulatory protein for in HIV replication has not been demonstrated using proteomics approaches and the interacting partners have not been found. The proposed research is significant because it will reveal novel mechanisms of HIV persistence that could be targeted for new therapeutic approaches directed to eliminate HIV in macrophage reservoirs.","7A"

2013,8402124,"5 R01 MD004065-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): U.S. rates of heterosexually transmitted HIV infection are dramatically higher among AAs than Whites. Concurrent partnerships (sexual partnerships that overlap in time) speed transmission of HIV through sexual networks much more effectively than does serial monogamy with the same total number of sexual partners and are more common among AAs than Whites. Recent mathematical simulations demonstrate that small decreases in the prevalence of concurrent partnerships can result in marked changes in population HIV transmission. Although successful control of the US HIV epidemic will ultimately require attention to the powerful contextual forces that promote AAs' high concurrency rates, there is an urgent need for behavioral interventions that reach large groups of people to promote safer sex practices and change adverse sexual network patterns.  The goal of this research is to develop effective mass media messages and strategies to decrease HIV transmission among AAs by reducing concurrent sexual partnerships. We will conduct qualitative and quantitative research among AA men and women, ages 18-34, in 7 eastern North Carolina counties to: 1) Construct prevention messages and communication strategies that target participation in concurrent partnerships. 2) Work with an established communications firm to design and implement a culturally competent eight-month mass communication campaign that informs AAs about the relationship between concurrency and HIV dissemination and decreases their willingness to participate in this network pattern. 3) Evaluate the campaign's effects on AAs' attitudes, beliefs, and norms about concurrency, reported participation in concurrent partnerships, and reported condom use through the conduct of phone surveys among 600 men and women before and after the campaign. This research represents a critical first step in the development of a mass media campaign that will play a key role in a multi-component HIV prevention program for AAs in the rural Southeastern US and throughout the nation.","8B"

Our focus in this renewal will be  From Discovery to Implementation and Back: Research Translation for the HIV/Substance (SU) Epidemic . Our current Center focused on interdisciplinary research related to HIV and substance use. During this period the Center experienced a growth in investigators (now located at 4 institutions) that provided new opportunities for synergy and collaboration, and investigators made many significant contributions to the field. However, HIV incidence, morbidity and mortality remain at unacceptably high rates, and substance use remains a critical barrier to reducing incidence and health disparities, accessing care, and maximizing the benefits of care. Substance users remain highly vulnerable and stigmatized, and a focus on the role of substance use in the epidemic is vital to our achieving the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) (i.e., to reduce new infections, improve HIV-related health outcomes and reduce HIV-related health disparities). In addition, there is a need to expedite the research translation process (from discovery to public health impact) and to incorporate knowledge about the rapidly changing contexts that impact the epidemic, including biomedical advances and socio-economic changes. To create an infrastructure to address these challenges, we have made significant changes in our scope and Core structure for this renewal. The overarching aims of this Center renewal are to: (1) enhance the quality and impact of research to support the goals of the NHAS; (2) enhance projects' research translation efforts; and (3) enable projects to incorporate the study of the contextual changes influencing the HIV-substance use epidemic. We will achieve these aims through 6 Cores: an Administrative Core and 5 Research Support Cores: (1) Transdisciplinary Theoretical Synthesis and Development; (2) Infectious Diseases and Biomedical; (3) Transdisciplinary Research Methods; (4) Comparative Effectiveness Research; and (5) Pilot Projects and Mentoring. These Cores will work to enhance synergy and productivity across investigators, and stimulate the development of new initiatives, new investigators and new knowledge to impact the HIV-substance use epidemic.",

The GHESKIO Centers is a nongovernmental organization dedicated to research, clinical services, and training in HIV/AIDS. Haiti has the highest rates of HIV/AIDS in the Western Hemisphere with -4% of the adult population infected with Clade B HIV-1. Heterosexual transmission predominates with a male to female ratio of 1 to 1. GHESKIO has received 22 years of uninterrupted NIH support including an NIH Merit Award and has over 70 peer-reviewed publications. GHESKIO investigators have conducted landmark clinical trials on the treatment and prophylaxis of HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis and coccidia co-infection. The Haitian Government has designated GHESKIO a  Public Utility , a status reserved for institutions which are essential to the  welfare of the Haitian people , such at the Red Cross. Dr. Jean William Pape is the Principal Investigator of this proposal. He is the Director of GHESKIO, Professor of Medicine at Cornell University, and a member of the US Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine. Dr. Pape is on the ACTG Scientific Steering Committee and is Co-chair of the HVTN Efficacy Trials Working Group.

2013,8402555,"5 R01 MD006058-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to other races/ethnicities, African Americans with HIV have lower levels of engagement in care, are less likely to be on antiretroviral treatment (ART), and are more likely to delay care and ART initiation; those on ART are less likely to be adherent at high enough levels for the treatment to be effective. We propose to test an innovative, culturally relevant treatment advocacy (TA) intervention for African Americans with HIV that targets social and cultural issues contributing to poor HIV treatment behaviors. TA, which has been sustained in many community organizations throughout the HIV epidemic, has never been systematically evaluated. TA facilitates patient navigation through the medical system and provides tailored HIV treatment education and client-centered counseling to improve adherence and engagement in care. TA targets social and contextual issues in healthcare and patients' lives by advocating to providers to improve patient-provider relationships, recommending changes in treatment and/or providers (if needed), and referring patients to mental health and social services. TA is particularly appropriate for African Americans with HIV, who may be mistrustful of providers: it can be conducted outside of the medical system in a safe, neutral community setting by individuals not associated with patients' healthcare. We developed a culturally relevant TA program that additionally discusses factors such as racism that undermine healthcare in Black communities, by acknowledging and directly addressing patients' medical mistrust and stigma as coping strategies that arise in response to oppression. The specific aims are to (1) conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of a culturally relevant TA program on adherence among African Americans with HIV; (2) identify culturally relevant mediators that explain the effects of treatment advocacy on antiretroviral treatment adherence among African Americans with HIV (e.g., improved behavioral adherence skills, coping with stress/discrimination, mental health, and patient satisfaction; lower levels of HIV misconceptions, internalized HIV stigma/homophobia, medical mistrust, and substance use); and (3) explore culturally relevant moderators of the effects of treatment advocacy on antiretroviral treatment adherence among African Americans with HIV (e.g., discrimination, incarceration, poverty, social support, spirituality, trauma). A sample of 200 African Americans with HIV will be randomly assigned to a TA intervention or wait-list control group. Participants will complete surveys at screening, and at 3- and 6-months post-baseline, to assess pre-, intra-, and post- intervention effects on adherence.","6B"

These three groups will form a unified CTU serving three DAIDS clinical research networks at one Clinical Research Site (CRS), The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in East Baltimore. The Site will be affiliated with the proposed (1) AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Network, (2) International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Thais (IMPAACT) Network, (3) HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN).        We have a long history of substantive contribution to the DAIDS scientific agenda, especially in the areas of prevention and treatment trials, early phase drug development and experimental therapeutics, neurology, hepatitis virus and HIV co-infection, and pediatric, adolescent, and maternal-fetal research. The investigators in this proposed CTU have authored over 1,000 published papers related to HIV infection, >300 of these in the past five years. The same investigators hold 21 HIV-related NIH-funded grants as Principal Investigator or Co-Principal Investigator for over $7,000,000 in annual direct costs. Our existing Adult ACTG Unit ranks first nationally in recruitment of African-Americans and women, many of whom have a history of substance abuse. Data management is rated outstanding, and subject retention is exemplary. The CRS will recruit from affiliated clinics serving more than 30,000 HIV-infected and at-risk persons. This new CTU will bring together a large group of accomplished investigators with a strong history of collaboration, and will allow consolidation of administrative resources for regulatory affairs, data management, outreach, and recruitment.  While preserving the successful aspects of our current HIV clinical trials structure, this reorganization will benefit the institution by providing a centralized, shared administrative core, which will allow an economy of scale that has not previously been possible at Johns Hopkins. Above all, the joining together of these three groups will provide access to HIV prevention and treatment research across the age spectrum, from birth to adolescence to adulthood and senescence.

These three sites have been invited to join the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG); the Case/UHC CRS as the lead site of a highly productive microbicide development program has also been invited to join the Microbicides Treatment Network (MTN) and though not formally invited, the Case/UHC CRS and the JCRC CRS propose participation with the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) in trials of HIV vaccines. The AIDS Clinical Trials Unit (ACTU) at Case has been continuously funded as part of the ACTG since 1987. In this period, the Case ACTU has had a stellar record of clinical trials performance. As a recent example, this ACTU was ranked #2 in total accruals to ACTG trials in the past three years and has always met or exceeded expectations in all aspects of clinical trials performance.        The overriding theme of the Case CTU is to bring to the clinical trials research agenda the fruits of basic and translational research that is ongoing at our institutions. Established scientific strengths of the unit have been in the arenas of immunologic monitoring, vaccine and other immune based therapeutic studies, studies of hepatitis C infection and of the metabolic complications of HIV disease. Not surprisingly therefore, Case with its subunits at UHC and MetroHealth Medical Center has been ranked #1 in scientific contributions to the ACTG over the past three years. With a more than 17 year history of scientific collaboration with clinicians and researchers in Uganda that includes the development of a sophisticated and productive laboratory and clinical trials research infrastructure at the JCRC, inclusion of this CRS as a member of the Case CTU is reasonable. As Case investigators are leading the AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC) international research effort and also are leading the Oral HIV Research Alliance (OHARA), the Case CTU will help bring together clinical and laboratory researchers from diverse disciplines to address in collaboration the most compelling questions in HIV research and care in the United States and in the developing world.

The CRSs are located at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), and Boston Medical Center (BMC), with an administrative component located at MGH. Throughout its 19-year history, investigators of the HMS/BMC AIDS CTU have made major contributions to therapeutic research in AIDS and have played a critical role in the scientific leadership of the ACTG: pivotal studies demonstrating clinical efficacy of combination antiretroviral therapy, protease inhibitor therapy, and combination therapy of HCV in co-infected persons all have been led by HMS/BMC AIDS CTU investigators. We propose a comprehensive, integrated clinical and translational research program that addresses five of the six priority areas described in the Network Leadership Group RFA (AI-05-001), including: 1) translational research/drug development; 2) optimization of clinical management, including co-morbidities; 3) vaccine development (therapeutic vaccines); 4) prevention of mother-to-child transmission (in collaboration with the Boston IMPAACT Clinical Trials Unit); and 5) prevention of HIV-1 infection. In addition, the Partners/Harvard/BMC AIDS CTU has formed mentoring partnerships with the Botswana CTU in Gaborone and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences/Peking Union Medical College CTU in Beijing through which investigators and research staff of the Partners/Harvard/BMC AIDS CTU provide training and guidance in the conduct of ACTG trials. Recruitment of women and subjects from traditionally underrepresented minority groups is a top priority of the Partners/Harvard/BMC AIDS CTU. This goal is aided by location of two of our CRSs (BWH and BMC in predominantly minority neighborhoods, and outreach efforts coordinated with our Community Advisory Board. Results of the studies proposed in this application will have a profound impact on public health by improving clinical care, preventing or delaying HIV disease progression, and reducing or eliminating the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV-1 infection and its associated complications.

Lpd participates in 3 enzyme complexes in intermediary metabolism and anti-oxidant defense. Its knockout severely attenuates Mtb in the mouse. We have identified and co-crystallized a species-selective Lpd inhibitor and will identify (and subsequently co-crystallize) others by applying orthogonal high throughput screens: one that tests 2 million compounds against the recombinant enzyme and the other using the hits from the first screen against replicating and non-replicating Mtb. HOAS, which we have crystallized, carries out a newly identified function of the reportedly essential gene Rv1248c, originally mis-annotated as E1 of 1-ketoglutarate (1-KG ) dehydrogenase. This is the first identification of a specific gene product that catalyzes carboligation of 1-KG and glyoxylate, producing HOA and its spontaneous decarboxylation product, hydroxylevulinate. We will replace Rv1248c with a Tet-regulated allele have developed a novel strategy to synthesize HOAS inhibitors from an analog of the cofactor thiamine diphosphate. This work will provide insights about the metabolic constraints faced by Mtb in the mouse, furnish tool compounds for the study of the roles of Lpd and HOAS together with other enzymes, establish if Lpd and HOAS warrant consideration as drug targets, and reveal new aspects of Mtb's intermediary metabolism.

In some of these populations, the HIV prevalence is more than 30% and HIV incidence is more than 4 per 100 person-years. The Malawi HRC has developed a long-term collaboration focused on a wide spectrum of HIV research that includes most aspects of HIV prevention, HIV treatment and care and nascent vaccine efforts. This consortium has inspired several cutting-edge research projects and very extensive training and technology transfers.      Each participating institution brings essential resources to this collaboration: the COM in Malawi provides a critical ink to all aspects of the health care infrastructure, appropriate patient populations, and in-country personnel required for a successful research program; Johns Hopkins University has provided leadership, training, clinical and laboratory resources, and a diverse scientific research agenda that led to innovative interventions; and UNC has provided access to new populations, increased capacity for biological research, pioneered research on sexually transmitted infections, and increased focus on issues of HIV treatment.      The Aims of this Proposal are I) To implement clinical trials that assess safety, efficacy and acceptability of appropriate interventions in all high priority research areas; II) To expand as needed to additional populations to further investigate HIV pathogenesis, evaluate the development of treatment and prevention strategies that are applicable to populations in resource-constrained settings, and respond to emerging scientific opportunities; and III) To work collaboratively with the Clinical Trials Networks Leadership to contribute to the scientific agenda.

Our work encompasses collaboration with other Lung Cancer SPORE'S, extensive leveraging of foundation, institutional, and commercial partnering support, and interaction with other NCI initiatives. We use flexibility of the SPORE funding mechanism to extend projects that continually evolve higher and higher translational potential and curtail those that do not. We emphasize incorporation of new concepts and directions to facilitate development of areas that are headed for ultimate translational verification and even movement to common clinical practice. Two projects, Projects 1 and 2, the latter a collaborative venture with the Colorado SPORE, stress biomarker research at the highest translational level. Both involve highest translational level validation of gene DNA hypermethylation markers with high promise for: a) in assays of tumor and lymph node DNA, restaging stage 1 to stage 3 lung cancer and predicting patients with highest risk for rapid disease recurrence; and b) in assays of sputum DNA, predicting individuals at highest risk for imminent development of lung cancer and /or facilitating early diagnosis of the disease. In both projects, implications of the markers for developing epigenetic approaches to adjuvant therapy and prevention will be directly explored. This work also links participation of the Hopkins SPORE with the consortium lloprost chemoprevention trials (Lung Cancer Biomarker Chemoprevention Consortium-LCBCC) involving other Lung Cancer SPORES and, especially, the Colorado SPORE. In terms of developing novel lung cancer therapies, Project 4 is at a very high translational level with correlative science to be conducted in the setting of first in human clinical trials for the inhibition of the enzyme, fatty acid synthase. Project 3, will explore the correlation, in non-small cell lung cancer, of newly found frequent mutations in the NRF2 stress response pathway, that renders this protein constitutively active in the nucleus, with the presence of drug resistance to commonly employed treatment regimens and the possibilities for inhibiting this pathway to reverse chemoresistance.",

The EBV oncoprotein Latent Membrane Protein 1 transforms B-cells through 2 essential signaling domains for B cell growth: Transformation effect site 1, which activates non- canonical NFkB and site 2, which activates canonical NFkB. Both NFkB pathways are necessary for infected cell growth and survival. To discover key components of LMP1 affected NFkB pathways, our AIMS are to: (1) Characterize key B-cell proteins required for LMP1 TES2 canonical NFkB activation for their role in TRAF6 and IKK activation, NEMO ubiquitination, and nuclear RelA phosphorylation. Candidates for missing kinases, phosphatases, E3 ligases, and scaffolds have been identified through a genome wide siRNA screen in 293 cells and will be evaluated in B cells. (2) Key B-cell proteins required for LMP1 TES1 non-canonical NFkB activation will be identified. This aim will focus on unique LMP1 effects through TRAFs, will employ LMP1 and TRAF genetic analyses and will identify novel cell proteins critical for LMP1-mediated non-canonical NFkB activation. (3) Identify combinations of AIM 1 and 2 target proteins knockdowns that create synthetic lethal effects, when both are depleted from EBV-transformed B cells. AIM3 experiments exploit what we learn in AIMS 1 and 2 to identify the Achilles' Heel of EBV-associated lymphomas.  NFkB small molecule inhibitors that are not specific for LMP1-mediated NFkB activation will likely be limited by side-effects, including inhibition of critical immune responses. These studies specifically address NCI goals outlined in PA10-290 by determining the mechanism by which EBV affects tumor promotion and progression, by discovering novel targets for rational drug discovery for the treatment of persons afflicted with AIDS-defining malignancies, and by using combinatorial genomic methodologies to further development of therapeutic agents. Our discoveries will elucidate new key targets in NFkB activation and more broadly advance priority target-based tool compound discovery.","2F"
2013,8403532,"5 R01 HD057789-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the U.S., sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect adolescents, especially African Americans [CDC, STD Surveillance, 2005]. Sexual risk behaviors do not solely explain the magnitude of their increased risk [Ellen el al., 1998], leading investigators to explore other explanations such as partner selection patterns. Numerous studies have found that certain sexual partner characteristics, more broadly referred to as sexual mixing patterns, are associated with STIs, with differences by gender and ethnicity. For example, compared to their peers, African American male youth more likely to have concurrent sex partners [CDC, YRBS, 2004] and African American female youth are more likely to have partners who have been incarcerated [Mertz, 2002; Pack, 2000; Oh, 1994]. Our current understanding of the socio-cultural determinants of sex partner selection is limited. Theories of sexual partner selection that could be proposed to inform our discussion have not been developed with impoverished youth of color in mind. The goal of the proposed study is to identify factors beyond socioeconomic status and individual sexual behaviors, particularly social contexts, which contribute to high rates of STIs in African American youth. Specifically, we are interested in examining gender role beliefs and their association with sexual partner selection and risk behaviors among an urban sample of youth. Gender role beliefs are culturally-bound beliefs and expectations about men and women that dictate unique and specific gendered behaviors. Through a demographically representative sample of 15-24 year olds in Baltimore, MD, the study aims to: 1. determine if gender role beliefs (hypermasculinity, hyperfemininity, power distribution in relationships), sexual partner selection patterns, and risky sexual behaviors vary by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and SES; 2. determine whether gender role beliefs mediate the effects of race/ethnicity and SES on sexual partner selection patterns and risky sexual behaviors; and 3. qualitatively explore gender role beliefs and sexual behaviors among 15-24 year old females in Baltimore, MD. To meet the study aims, we will conduct a random-sample cross-sectional survey (N=480) and in-depth interviews (N=40) of 15-24 year olds across Baltimore City, Maryland. The study is one of the first community-based studies of gender role beliefs and partner selection patterns among an economically and racially diverse sample of male and female youth.","5B"
2013,8403631,"5 R01 CA117830-08","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): KSHV is the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) that occurs most frequently and severely in HIV-AIDS. KSHV has also been implicated in several lymphoid disorders, including pleural effusion lymphoma (PEL) and Castleman's disease. Long-term latent infection in B-lymphocytes and persistent infection in endothelial cells is thought to be a major driving force for KSHV-associated pathogenesis. Latent infection is characterized by the transcription of several viral genes associated with viral genome stability and host-cell survival. The major latency transcript is a multicistronic message that consists of the LANA, vCyclin, and vFLIP genes, which can be alternatively spliced to generate the viral microRNAs (vmiRNAs) and Kaposin genes. The latency transcriptional control is also responsible for the regulation of the vGPCR gene, which has been implicated in KS pathogenesis. Proper regulation of these viral transcripts is critical for viral genome persistence during latency and for pathogenesis in KSHV infected lesions. Our preliminary data indicates that this region of the viral chromosome is protected from epigenetic silencing by the chromatin insulator protein CTCF and colocalization with cohesin subunits (e.g. SMC1, SMC3, Rad21). In addition, changes in CTCF-cohesin interactions contribute to the cell cycle activation of vGPCR in latently infected PEL cells. We have also found that these CTCF sites in the latency control region are important for the programming of RNA polymerase II elongation and mRNA processing. In Aim 1, we will determine how the CTCF-cohesin complex contributes to the regulation of latency transcription, and protects the major latency control region from epigenetic silencing. We have also found that viral encoded miRNAs contribute to the epigenetic programming of the viral chromosome during latency. We propose in Aim 2 of this proposal to determine whether CTCF-cohesin complex regulates vmiRNA expression, and additionally, whether vmiRNAs coregulate the function of CTCF- cohesins in regulating the epigenetic state of the latent viral chromosome. Finally, we propose to investigate the mechanism of a small molecule inhibitor that selectively deregulates KSHV latency transcription. Glychyrrizic acid (GA) is a bioactive natural product derived from licorice that selectively inhibits KSHV positive PEL cell proliferation. We have found that GA deregulates RNA polymerase II interactions with the CTCF- cohesin complex at the LANA 5' UTR. We have used chemical affinity to identify candidate target molecules of GA. In Aim 3, we propose to further characterize the mechanism of GA deregulation of LANA transcription and its potential targeting of the CTCF-cohesin complex. Together, these aims focus on a novel mechanism of gene regulation that maintains latency gene expression during latency, restricts the pathogenic expression of vGPCR, and may serve as a potential target for small molecule intervention in KSHV-associated disease.","2F"
2013,8403726,"5 R01 CA129560-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lymphoid malignancies such as lymphoma and leukemia often compromise host defense and have evolved mechanisms to evade immune surveillance. Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a poorly immunogenic, highly malignant B-cell tumor characterized by chromosomal translocations that constitutively activate the c-myc oncogene. Effective tumor immune responses usually involve the stimulation and maintenance of tumor specific CD8+ HLA class I restricted T effector cells and tumor-specific CD4+ class II restricted T cells. Several groups have shown that BL can not present antigens (Ags) by class I molecules which contribute to their escaping immune recognition from tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. Recently, studies have also shown that HLA class II-restricted CD4+ cytotoxic T cells (CTL) could be generated against BL and as well as non-Hodgkins follicular lymphoma (FL). These studies support the feasibility of using sufficient tumor specific CD4+ T cells to eliminate B-cell tumors. Most B-cell tumors, including BL, express class II molecules, could provide their own MHC class II Ag presentation and be targets for CD4+ T cells. As BL are very poorly immunogenic, we hypothesize that BL and other B-cell lymphomas may also have a defect in stimulation of tumor-specific CD4+ T cells. Our data suggest that CD4+ T cells are unable to recognize Ag in association with HLA class II on BL/FL cells whereas, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infected B-cell lymphoblasts (B-LCL) efficiently process and present Ags to T cells in the context of class II molecules. The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the defect(s) in BL/FL responsible for this loss of Ag presentation by HLA class II and to assess whether these identified defect(s) are a global trait of B-cell lymphomas. We will determine the mechanisms for poor class II restricted HLA Ag presentation by BL, FL and other B-cell lymphomas using the following three specific aims: (1) Determine the defective step(s) in Burkitt lymphoma and other B-cell lymphomas that suppress the stimulation of Ag-specific, CD4+ HLA-class II-restricted T cells, (2) Determine mechanisms induced at pH 5.5 that restore the ability of Burkitt lymphoma to stimulate Ag-specific, CD4+ HLA-class II-restricted T cells, and (3) Identify and clone the inhibitory factors shed by Burkitt lymphoma at pH 5.5 that suppress HLA class II-restricted Ag presentation. Cellular, biochemical, molecular, proteomics and functional approaches will be employed to test these aims. These studies will elucidate novel mechanism(s) for restoring Ag presentation to BL cells and for suppressing B-LCL and DC Ag-class II presentation. The elucidated mechanisms will likely spur development of novel strategies to restore CD4+ T cell recognition and clearance of BL and other B-cell lymphomas.","2F"
2013,8403756,"5 R01 CA095318-09","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  ?-herpesviruses are closely associated with the development of lymphoproliferative disease and lymphomas, as well as other cancers. Notably, herpesviruses in general are able to establish life-long infections in their natural host(s). The long term goal of this research is to understand how ?-herpesviruses manipulate normal B or T cell development to persist within the lymphoid compartment of the infected host. Understanding the mechanisms used by ?- herpesviruses to persist in the infected host may lead to the development of strategies for interfering with chronic infection. Such therapies would be useful in the management of immunosuppressed individuals (e.g., organ transplant and AIDS patients) who are particularly susceptible to developing ?-herpesvirus-associated tumors. The focus of the proposed studies on murine ?-herpesvirus 68 (MHV68; also referred to as MHV68) represents an ongoing effort to develop a tractable small animal model for characterizing establishment and maintenance of ?-herpesvirus latency within the lymphoid compartment, and to determine the importance of B cell latency in the maintenance of chronic infection. The specific aims of this renewal application are as follows: Aim 1. Characterization of MHV68 immortalized murine fetal liver-derived B cell lines:  1.a. Identify stage of B cell differentiation of MHV68 infected FLC-derived B cell lines; 1.b. Characterize viral gene expression in MHV68 infected FLC-derived B cell lines; 1.c. Determine what viral genes are essential for FLC-derived B cell immortalization; and 1.d. Adoptive transfer of MHV68 infected FLC-derived B cell lines into immunocompetent  mice.  Aim 2. Characterization of MHV68 latency programs and viral antigens:  2.a. Identify viral genes expressed in distinct latently infected B cell and macrophage populations;  2.b. Characterize alterations in target cells with viral mutants and altered routes of  inoculation; and  2.c. Characterize newly identified latency-associated gene products.  Aim 3. Role of B cells in maintaining chronic MHV68 infection:  3.a. Determine whether MHV68 infects progenitor cells in the bone marrow;  3.b. Characterize latently infected cell types in B cell-deficient (MuMT) mice; and  3.c. Assess consequences of depleting B cells prior to or following MHV68 infection.","2F"
2013,8403765,"5 R01 CA142362-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) remains the most common tumor arising in patients with HIV/AIDS, and involvement of the oral cavity represents one of the most common clinical manifestations of this tumor. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) replication and ongoing infection of target cells plays an important role in KS pathogenesis. An amino acid membrane transport protein subunit, xCT, maintains intracellular glutathione stores to enhance the survival of cells producing reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and xCT was recently identified as a fusion-entry receptor for KSHV (Kaleeba and Berger, Science, 2006). A number of intracellular and extracellular triggers regulate xCT expression, including binding of the xCT promoter by transcription regulators and the activation of positive transcription regulators by RNS. We have determined recently that xCT is expressed by multiple cell types within KS lesions and circulating mononuclear cells from HIV-infected patients, with cells from KSHV/HIV co-infected patients exhibiting the highest xCT expression. However, it is unknown whether KSHV itself regulates xCT expression to promote KSHV infection and persistence in the local environment. KSHV infects macrophages within KS lesions, and macrophages are a principal source of RNS. Using a novel macrophage cell culture system, our preliminary data suggest that KSHV microRNA suppress BACH-1, a negative transcription regulator of xCT expression, and that KSHV induces RNS secretion by macrophages. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that KSHV promotes its own persistence in the local environment by upregulating xCT expression through both paracrine and autocrine mechanisms, and that targeting xCT regulatory pathways reduces KSHV infection and persistence in the microenvironment. To address this hypothesis, we propose two independent aims: 1) to determine mechanisms and functional outcomes for xCT regulation by KSHV; and 2) to determine clinical relationships between KSHV infection, xCT expression and RNS production in HIV-infected patients at greatest risk for KS. Through these efforts, we hope to provide the framework for developing novel therapeutic strategies for KS through the targeting of xCT and the reduction of KSHV infection and persistence within the tumor microenvironment.","2F"
2013,8403787,"5 R01 CA142723-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the primary risk factor for cervical cancer, which is the second most prevalent cancer in women worldwide causing 15% of female cancer mortality. Papillomaviruses establish persistent infection by maintaining their genomes as episomes in infected cells. In the HPV life cycle that is tightly linked to the differentiation program of host epithelium, E2 ensures that the viral genome is established, replicated and maintained in the early-infected basal epithelial cells. During epithelium differentiation, E2 also contributes to the tight regulation of the viral oncogene transcription to create a conducive environment for successful completion of the viral life cycle. Loss of E2 expression leads to dysregulated viral oncogene expression and has been mechanistically linked to malignant progression of HPV positive lesions. Our previous work identified the cellular protein Brd4 (bromodomain-containing protein 4) as a novel receptor for E2. Brd4-E2 interaction functions in viral episome maintenance, viral transcriptional activation and repression of the viral oncogenes. Our studies established that Brd4 is highly expressed in the basal epithelial layer, supporting its role in E2 functions during the early phase of the viral life cycle. However, little is known about how Brd4 regulates the multiple functions of E2, nor is it clear how this virus-host interaction contributes to the differentiation- dependent HPV life cycle. This grant application aims to identify and characterize additional cellular components that regulate the E2-Brd4 functions, to determine how Brd4 contributes to E2 transcriptional regulation, and to investigate the functional impact of E2-Brd4 interactions in the HPV life cycle during epithelium differentiation. Infection by the HPV is the most common sexually transmitted agent, afflicting 50-80% of the population. This research will provide greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the HPV life cycle and malignant progression. The new mechanisms identified in this study will provide a point of departure for developing new compounds to abrogate the virus-host interaction and cure HPV persistent infections. Mechanistic insights into how E2-Brd4 interactions repress the viral oncogenes that account for the tumorigenic nature of HPV-associated diseases will offer promising leads for novel therapeutic strategies. This study will provide a paradigm for other episomal DNA tumor viruses, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and Epstein-Barr virus, both of which also target Brd4.","2F"
2013,8403915,"5 R01 CA034722-29","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Polyomavirus middle T (MT) is responsible for murine polyomavirus (PyV) tumorigenesis. Otherwise wild type viruses that have mutant MT fail to induce tumors. Transgenic MT causes tumors in many tissues, providing valuable models for diseases such as breast cancer. Studies of MT led to the discovery of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Much evidence suggests that continued study of MT will yield new insights into neoplastic transformation and tumorigenesis. Our central hypothesis is that MT promotes transformation by the modulation of specific steps in cell signaling that affect not only the tumor cell itself, but also associated stromal cells, to support tumor progression.  We will focus on three areas where MT studies can offer novel insight into neoplastic transformation: 1) Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A): The role we have uncovered for the A? isoform of PP2A in activation of c- src by MT points to the importance of specific isoforms. We will examine the role of both A subunit isoforms of PP2A and loss of specific trimeric ABC complexes of PP2A in MT transformation. We have evidence for a new model whereby MT brings substrates to PP2A for dephosphorylation. The lipins, which are both enzymes of the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) metabolism and also transcriptional coactivators, are examples of such substrates that point to novel PP2A-dependent signaling in transformation. We will test their role in transformation. Guided by a mutant defective in lipin binding, we will also use mass spectrometry of mutant and wild type (WT) MT to uncover additional substrates. 2) PI3K: MT mutant E349K shows that there is a step, so far unappreciated, between PI3K recruitment to activated tyrosine kinases and signaling to activate downstream targets such as Akt. The nature of the defect will be determined in studies of PI lipids and protein localization. Using mass spectrometry comparing E349K to WT, we will seek to identify the cellular protein(s) responsible. Identification of a new intermediate in PI3K signaling would be paradigm shifting and offer new possibilities for therapeutic intervention. 3) Cytokines: Although cytokine expression is well recognized to be an important part of tumorigenesis, little progress has been made in understanding the signals that control the patterns of cytokine expression. More importantly, the idea that cancer signaling alters responses to cytokines is largely unexplored. Our evidence shows that MT both induces cytokine expression and at the same time alters the response of tumor cells to cytokines. We will determine the spectrum of effects on cytokine expression and response that MT has both in tumor cells and on stromal cells by gene array and protein analysis. Using genetic tools we will investigate the mechanisms MT uses to do this and carry out novel tests of how the genetic background of the host modulates responses. Finally, we will ask how these effects determine macrophage recruitment in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo studies. Our work will thus close gaps in our knowledge of cytokines and determine their contribution to MT mammary tumorigenesis.","2F"
2013,8403916,"5 R01 CA065883-18","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is 100% associated with the presence of the oncogenic human herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus. It is divided into two sub types: poorly differentiated (type II) and undifferentiated (type III). Type III is by far the most common form of the disease. Although a major world heath problem, NPC remains understudied. Furthermore, because it develops in an occult site and initially presents with symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract infection, it often remains undetected until it has reached an advanced stage. This is critical because early stage disease is readily treatable and potentially curable, whereas therapeutics for advanced stage disease result in high morbidity and relapse rates and there are no effective options for treating metastatic disease. Therefore there is a pressing need for the development of new therapies that target advanced disease. In this study we are using systems biology techniques to identify candidate molecules and processes that contribute to NPC tumor growth and metastasis. The intent is to investigate underlying mechanisms that may also identify targets for new therapies. In this work in vitro and in vivo (mouse) models of NPC tumor growth and metastasis will be developed. In vitro, cultured primary epithelial cells, well characterized NPC cell lines and tumor cells cultured directly from NPC biopsies will be used. In vivo ectopic tumor growth and a newly developed orthotopic NPC metastasis model will be used employing xenotransplanted NPC cell lines and tumor biopsy samples. These models will allow the evaluation of how processes, already identified in preliminary studies, contribute to disease development and progression. These are:  1. to test the idea that type II and type III NPC are distinct at the molecular genetic level based on preferential deregulation of the PI3kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in type III NPC. Does this deregulation make type III tumors more vulnerable to drugs that target this pathway and will such drugs impede the invasive and metastatic behavior of the tumors in vivo.  2. To study the role of the chemokine CCL5 (RANTES) in mediating epithelial and NPC tumor cell migration, invasion and metastasis.  3. Study the role of the EBV encoded latent proteins LMP1 and LMP2a in tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, activation of the PI3linase/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and induction of RANTES dependent  migration, invasion and metastasis.  4. To develop quantitative profiles of EBV miRNA expression in EBV associated tumors with special emphasis on NPC. Apply clustering algorithms to these data sets to define miRNAs whose expression is up- or down-regulated in NPC in order to identify their target genes and ultimately assess the role of these genes in tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.","2F"

We have recently found that use of HAART is independently associated with worse airway obstruction. The overall goal of this project is to investigate the hypothesis that immune restoration through HAART leads to increased airway obstruction/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease via propagation of a chronic inflammatory response to pulmonary pathogens and/or autoantigens. We will study the effects of HAART initiation through a prospective longitudinal study of HIV outpatients at the University of Pittsburgh, as well as through an analysis of specimens archived as part of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study and the Women's Interagency Study. Research Aims: (1) To test the hypothesis that HAART initiation is associated with increased airway obstruction and/or emphysema. (2) To test the hypothesis that initiating HAART induces a  modified immune restoration syndrome,  creating a pro-inflammatory environment in response to an underlying pathogen and/or through unmasking of autoantigens. (3) To test the hypothesis that development of a chronic inflammatory response, either in response to Pneumocystis or autoantigens, is associated with increased airway obstruction and/or emphysema. Career Goals: This research proposal presents a comprehensive plan by which the P.I. will help determine pathophysiologic mechanisms connecting HAART and COPD and will also achieve the following: 1. Broaden the candidate's ability to perform clinical/translational studies through the experience of conducting a prospective longitudinal study; 2.

2013,8404010,"5 R01 EY013615-09","Project Summary Although the HSV-1 gene(s) that is involved in eye disease is not yet known, we have demonstrated previously that immunization of mice with gK, but not with any other known HSV-1 glycoprotein, significantly exacerbates CS and facial dermatitis following ocular HSV-1 infection of different strains of mice. This exacerbation of the CS occurs independently of the virus strain used for infection or the strain of mouse. As gK is essential to HSV-1 infectivity, we analyzed its contribution to CS using recombinant viruses with two extra copies of gK and found that, similar to gK immunization, mice infected with this recombinant virus have elevated levels of CS. The exacerbation of disease is of particular interest as it would appear to mimic the clinical disease process typical of individuals with a history of HSV-1 recurrences. This provided the basis for our innovative approach to the problem of identifying potential therapeutic targets for prevention of ocular HSV-1 infection and HSV-1- induced CS. Our progress during the past funding period provides novel insights into the potential mechanisms by which gK may regulate primary infections and CS. We have now shown that: (1) The cleaved form of gK binds to signal peptide peptidase (SPP) and increases virus replication (Preliminary Studies) and (2) The 8-mer within the signal sequence of gK following cleavage by SPP up-regulates the CD8+CD25+ responses in the cornea of infected mice leading to exacerbation of CS. Based on these data, we have formulated the central hypothesis that the pathogenic effects of gK during primary infection are mediated by two different, but inter-related, mechanisms in which the cleaved form of gK exerts its activities by binding to SPP leading to higher levels of virus replication, while the 8-mer within the signal sequence of gK following cleavage by SPP up-regulates CD8+CD25+ T cells in vivo leading to greater levels of eye disease. We propose to test this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that binding of the cleaved form of gK to SPP plays a major role in virus replication and thus infectivity in vitro and in vivo. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that the 8-mer (ITAYGLVL) within the signal sequence of gK binds to MHC-I on DCs and mediates up-regulation of CD8+CD25+ T cells, thus leading to exacerbation of CS in ocularly infected mice.","2F,6D"
2013,8404036,"5 K23 HD069199-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vitamin D is critical in many physiologic and pathophysiologic processes including inflammatory status, immune function, and cardiovascular health. Vitamin D deficiency is widespread among HIV-infected adults and children. This is particularly alarming since there is a higher risk than the general population for complications like osteoporosis, non-AIDS-defining malignancies, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) - all diseases associated with vitamin D deficiency. It is not known how much vitamin D deficiency heightens the risk of complications like CVD, affects immune function and disease progression, or interferes with optimal treatment in the HIV population. The impact of vitamin D deficiency in the HIV population may be compounded even further since the etiology of HIV-related complications like CVD is thought to be related in part to inflammation and detrimental endothelial effects associated with chronic HIV infection-similar proposed mechanisms as vitamin D deficiency. Data suggest that optimal vitamin D status may be protective against these HIV-related complications, and optimizing vitamin D status with oral supplementation in HIV-infected individuals may improve the risk of HIV-related complications by decreasing inflammation and/or improving endothelial dysfunction, and may improve immune function even in individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Developing suitable repletion strategies is crucial to maximizing health status, particularly in HIV-infected children and young adults, where an opportunity exists for disease prevention. However, the best method of vitamin D repletion is not known, and data suggest that some antiretroviral medications interfere with vitamin D metabolism. Thus, we hypothesize that (1) optimizing vitamin D status to the current Institute of Medicine's (IOM) suggested 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration of e20 ng/mL improves CVD risk, inflammation, and CD4 cell counts in HIV-infected individuals, (2) increasing 25(OH)D concentrations to >30 ng/mL improves CVD risk and inflammation to a greater degree than increasing eto 20 ng/mL (the concentration some experts consider optimal for cardiovascular health), and (3) a  high dose  of oral vitamin D is necessary to achieve 25(OH)D concentrations >30 ng/mL. These hypotheses will be addressed by determining the longitudinal relationships between serum 25(OH)D concentrations, carotid intima-media thickness, pulse wave velocity, pro-inflammatory biomarkers, and CD4 cell counts in HIV-infected children and young adults in a double-blinded, randomized-controlled trial of three different vitamin D dosing regimens given over 24 months in HIV-infected children and young adults (ages 10-25 years) with vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <20 ng/mL). We will also evaluate the 25(OH)D concentrations from each arm after 6, 12, and 24 months of supplementation, in order to determine a dose-response relationship. These findings could have a sizable impact on health in this population, since vitamin D therapy is inexpensive and associated with few adverse side effects. The PI is an exceptional candidate who is a pediatric infectious diseases specialist with a proven research focus in the metabolic and cardiovascular complications of HIV. She is mentored by a committed, multidisciplinary team of senior investigators with extensive experience in both mentoring and in the research methodologies relevant to this proposal. Future training in all aspects of clinical research, cardiovascular disease risk assessment, and clinical nutrition is planned to facilitate the PI's development into a successful independent physician scientist.","6J,7A"
2013,8404043,"5 R01 HD054511-06","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to develop new statistical methods for estimating prevalence and the size of at-risk groups in sexually transmitted infection epidemics. We also aim to estimate other policy-relevant quantities such as the number of orphans and children impacted, and treatment needs. We consider two types of epidemic: generalized epidemics, in which the disease is spread throughout the general population, and concentrated epidemics, in which the disease is largely confined to at-risk groups such as intravenous drug users, sex workers and men who have sex with men. Our goal is to develop methods appropriate for countries with sparse data, most of which are developing countries. For generalized epidemics, we propose a susceptible-infected model with a stochastic infection rate. We will develop a Bayesian approach to estimating the model from clinic data over time and sparse household surveys. We will extend the model to take account of changes in treatment availability, and to produce provincial as well as national estimates. For concentrated epidemics, we will first develop new integrated Bayesian methods for estimating the sizes of the main at-risk groups from fragmentary data, including mapping or hotspot data, behavioral surveillance data, program enrollment data and the overlaps between them. Much recent data comes from two relatively new network-based data collection methods, respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and the network scale-up method. We will develop methods for estimating unknown population size from multiple data sources, including RDS and network scale-up. We will then develop methods for estimating at-risk group size and prevalence over time, using a dynamic Bayesian model. We will produce publicly available software to implement our new methods and make them available to the research community and policy-makers.","5A,5D"
2013,8408795,"5 R01 CA081135-15","Project Summary High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are etiological agents of cervical cancer, the second most common cause of cancer death in women worldwide. In addition, high-risk HPVs are also associated with a number of other anogenital tract carcinomas, including, anal, vulvar and penile cancers as well as approximately 20% of oral cancers. Despite the recent introduction of a prophylactic vaccine that is to protect from infection with some high-risk HPV types, it will be several decades before this will affect cervical cancer incidence and death rates. Currently 10 women succumb to cervical cancer every day in the US, alone. HPV-associated carcinogenesis is driven by HPV E6/E7 oncoprotein expression; these proteins not only contribute to induction of premalignant lesions, but also mechanistically contribute to malignant progression, a relatively rare event that generally occurs several years to decades after the initial infection. Progression is frequently associated with HPV genome integration into a host cellular chromosome, a terminal event for the viral life cycle. As a consequence, E6 and E7 are the only viral proteins that are consistently expressed in cervical cancers. This project is focused on investigating biological activities of high-risk HPV oncoproteins and to determine whether they could be harnessed as a novel therapeutic modality for high-risk HPV-associated lesions and cancers. In aim 1, it is proposed to determine the mechanistic basis of HPV16 E7-induced trophic sentinel signaling in human keratinocytes, a cellular tumor suppressor pathway that thwarts the proliferation of cells that have suffered oncogenic alterations, which lead to aberrant cell proliferation. Aim 2 is to determine the mechanistic basis of HPV16 E7-induced autophagy in human keratinocytes and if/how this is connected to trophic sentinel signaling. Since autophagy is an evolutionary ancient and conserved response to metabolic stress we will determine how HPV16 E7 expression causes increased metabolic requirements. Aim 3 is to investigate the mechanism by which HPV16 E6 abrogates HPV16 E7 induced trophic sentinel signaling. In this aim we will test whether small molecule inhibitors of the pathways that E6 and E7 may be targeting and that are currently in the clinic may be harnessed as a novel therapeutic modality for HPV-associated lesions and cancers. Since the cellular pathways that are targeted by the E6 and E7 oncoproteins are frequently rendered dysfunctional by mutation in non-HPV associated human solid tumors, these studies may also be applicable for therapy of other human cancers.","2F"
2013,8408796,"5 R01 CA082036-14","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is etiologically linked with KS, primary effusion lymphomas (PELs) and multicentric Castleman's disease. These diseases occur in AIDS and in other patients and current therapies are limited. KSHV latently infects the vast majority of tumor cells and viral DNA persists as a multiple copy, extrachromosomal, circular episome. To persist in proliferating cells, episomes must replicate and efficiently segregate to daughter nuclei. KSHV latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA) binds terminal repeat (TR) DNA to mediate KSHV episome persistence. LANA mediates TR DNA replication and binds TR DNA to tether episomes to mitotic chromosomes for efficient segregation to progeny nuclei.  LANA is essential for KSHV episome maintenance and central to viral latency. The N- and C-terminal regions are essential for LANA function and bind mitotic chromosomes and TR DNA. However, the role(s) of internal domains in LANA mediated episome maintenance are unknown. We have now identified a 68 amino acid internal LANA region which exerts a critical effect on episome maintenance. We have also found that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) exerts a potent inhibitory effect on LANA mediated episome persistence. Small molecule inhibitors of LANA function would be powerful tools to probe LANA function and viral latency and would provide new therapeutic strategies. However, currently, no such inhibitors have been identified or developed.  This work will address critical aspects of LANA biology. The newly identified internal LANA region critical for episome maintenance will be investigated, including its mechanism of action. Such knowledge will provide insight into the basic mechanisms of LANA mediated episome persistence. The biology of PARP1 inhibition of episome maintenance will be investigated. Study of this area is critical since PARP1 appears to be a key component of the host response to KSHV infection. Small molecule inhibitors of LANA function will be identified. These compounds will provide novel probes of KSHV latency and serve as potential therapeutic and preventive agents for KSHV malignancy.","2F"

Public health intervention research has produced no theory- driven, evidence-based interventions for transgender women. The unique cultural context of transgender women creates distinct risk factors that require systematic investigation and then integration into culturally  elevant, community-based approaches to intervention. This K08 application describes a comprehensive,  ntegrated training and research plan designed to serve as a pathway to scientific independence and the expertise to develop and test an innovative and urgently needed intervention to improve health outcomes among a highly marginalized population disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. The following  raining objectives are proposed: (1) to acquire expertise in the evaluation and application of theories of behavior change to marginalized populations; (2) to enhance skills in the use of mixed methods data collection and analysis, with an emphasis on techniques relevant to measurement development and theory testing; (3) to gain knowledge and experience with clinical trials methodology, including issues of sampling, randomization, design, protocol development, and ethics; and (4) to obtain training and experience in methods for developing, implementing, and evaluating culturally grounded, theory-driven HIV prevention interventions for transgender women. The specific research aims of the mentored original research are: (1) to describe the role of transgender women's unique cultural context on their HIV-related risk and protective  factors; (2) to create new and to adapt existing quantitative measures to more accuratelyassess  psychosocial dimensions and behavior relevant to transgender women's HIV risk and protective factors; (3)  to identify psychosocial factors associatedwith HIV-related sexual and injection risk behaviors and protective  factors among transgender women; and (4) to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a theory-  driven, culturally grounded HIV prevention intervention for transgender women. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Transgender women (assigned 'male' at birth but identify as female) are an understudied and highly vulnerable group, with HIV prevalence rates in the range of 22 to 68%. Due to stigma and discrimination, they may seek affirmation in ways that increase risk. This project seeks to investigate unique risk factors to develop a culturally relevant HIV prevention intervention for these high-risk women.

2013,8409800,"5 R34 MH092208-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study is designed to reduce racial disparities in HIV treatment outcomes by developing and pilot-testing a Motivational Interviewing intervention to support patient decision-making about antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and to enhance motivation to begin ART. Antiretroviral therapy has dramatically extended the lives and reduced the suffering of people with HIV, but many clinically eligible patients refuse ART. Others stop ART without notifying their medical providers. Although adherence to ART has been extensively studied, much less is known about factors which lead patients to accept or reject ART altogether. Our preliminary studies indicate that many patients are ambivalent about ART, and that cognitive factors such as a belief in HIV conspiracy theories and mistrust of the medical system may contribute to reluctance to initiate or continue ART. We propose to develop an intervention grounded in cognitive theory which primarily uses Motivational Interviewing techniques to weaken belief barriers and reduce ambivalence about ART initiation. The population of interest is inner-city African- Americans with HIV who are not currently receiving ART and are suboptimally engaged in care. The intervention will be tested both in an HIV outpatient clinic setting and an AIDS Service Organization (ASO) setting. Community advisors and expert consultants will contribute to the development and iterative refinement of the intervention protocol. The protocol will be tested first in a small uncontrolled case series (n=10), and then in a larger randomized pilot (n=80) designed to allow preliminary tests of the intervention's effects on key attitudinal measures (perceived barriers to ART, motivation to begin treatment), appropriate HIV medical care utilization, and ART initiation compared to an attention-only control. Institutional barriers to implementing the intervention in the outpatient clinic and ASO settings will be identified and addressed. If the preliminary tests of the intervention provide positive results, then a larger R01 study with a randomized controlled trial design is planned, using the intervention manual developed in the present proposed study. This project is highly innovative in its focus on HIV conspiracy beliefs and its target of ART initiation.","5C"

This goal will be accomplished by four aims: AIM 1 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Practice (i.e., standard prevention services), in preventing illicit drug use; AIM 2 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Control, in preventing cigarette use; AIM 3 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Control, in preventing unprotected sexual behavior; and AIM 4 is to assess the extent to which family functioning mediates the effects of the intervention on illicit drug use, cigarette use, and unprotected sexual behavior. Twenty four middle schools with a total sample of 744 Hispanic adolescents from a wide geographic area of Miami-Dade County will be randomized using a block design to one of two conditions: Familias Unidas or Community Practice. The Familias Unidas intervention has been evaluated and found to be efficacious in two separate randomized controlled trials. In the first study (Pantin et al., 2003), Familias Unidas was shown to be efficacious relative to a no intervention control condition in increasing family functioning and reducing behavior problems (Prado et al., 2006), risk factors for youth illicit drug use and unprotected sex. In the second randomized controlled trial (Prado et al., in press), Familias Unidas was found to be efficacious, relative to two attention control conditions, in preventing cigarette use and illicit drug use. Familias Unidas was also found to be efficacious relative to both of the control conditions in preventing/reducing unprotected sexual behavior at last sexual intercourse. Finally, family functioning was found to mediate the effects of intervention condition on the outcomes. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing illicit drug use over time; (H2) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing cigarette use over time; and (H3) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing unprotected sexual behavior over time. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Familias Unidas on illicit drug use will be partially mediated by family functioning; (H2a) the effect of Familias Unidas on cigarette use will be partially mediated by family functioning and (H3a) the effect of Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by family functioning.","5A"
2013,8409807,"5 R01 DA025694-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Theory has posited that discrepancies in acculturation between Hispanic adolescents and their parents are associated with conduct problems, drug/alcohol use, and sexual risk taking. These discrepancies may also be associated with compromised levels of positive development. These effects are assumed to occur via poor family functioning. However, empirical tests of the differential acculturation hypothesis have yielded inconsistent results. The proposed study will use a multidimensional model of acculturation - including behaviors, values, and identifications - and will use state-of-the-art latent variable methods to examine parent-adolescent discrepancies in acculturation and their effects on behavioral outcomes through family functioning. 300 Hispanic adolescents and their primary parents will be randomly selected from six public high schools in Miami and from six public high schools in Los Angeles. Adolescents and parents will be assessed twice per year between 9th and 12th grade. Parents and adolescents will complete measures of Hispanic and American cultural behaviors, values, and identifications; family functioning; and adolescent behavior. Adolescents will report on their drug use, sexual behavior, and indices of thriving (prosocial behavior, school grades, and positive attitudes and traits). The results will inform theory regarding the extent to which discrepancies in acculturation lead to compromised family functioning in Hispanic families, and the extent to which these problems in family functioning are associated with conduct problems, drug/alcohol use, sexual risk taking, and impaired thriving. The results will also be important regarding the need to incorporate cultural concerns into efforts to prevent problems and to promote positive development in Hispanic adolescents and families.","5B"

As a call to action, a collaborative team of researchers proposes to conduct a four-year behavioral-driven research study to modify, implement and evaluate the efficacy of a promising brief condom promotion program in a two-arm randomized trial among African American males 18-24 years from 12 community centers on Chicago's South Side. Accordingly, we propose the following specific aims and related set of research questions:   1. Modify, implement, and assess the efficacy of a condom promotion program for African American males. 1.1. Will participants randomly assigned to the intervention report a statistically significant increase in the frequency of condom use and decrease in unprotected sexual intercourse (primary outcomes) relative to those assigned to the comparison group? 1.2. Will the intervention produce statistically significant positive effects on secondary outcomes (e.g., condom use self-efficacy, condom use decisional balance, etc.) relative to the comparison group? 1.3. Will the secondary outcomes mediate the relationship between intervention status and condom use (the primary outcome)?   2. Assess characteristics of program implementation and its relationship to changes in behavioral outcomes. 2.1. What was the level of implementation fidelity? 2.2. How is variation in implementation fidelity related to change in primary outcomes? For a nine-month formative phase, we will conduct a series of qualitative interviews with key informants and the target population to modify our existing program. Over the next 16 months, we will recruit 520 study participants from our recruitment sites to implement the intervention and comparison programs and assess the efficacy of the intervention program on a series of primary and secondary outcomes. Assuming 30% attrition rate (n=156), we expect to collect complete outcome data via Audio Computer Assisted Self Interview (ACASI) from about 364 participants over 12-months. In addition, we will conduct biological assessment of STDs to validate participants' self-reports on sexual behaviors at all assessment points. This proposed study is an extension of a recently completed NIH-funded R21 (PI: Kennedy) to develop, implement, and pilot a brief condom promotion program for African American males (Kennedy et al., 2007a,b,c; Kennedy et al., under review).

In this renewal application, we propose to continue our work to address emerging questions about global HIV prevention, treatment, and priority setting in substance-using populations. We will extend our prior epidemiologic modeling work by assessing portfolios of prevention and treatment interventions, by addressing these interventions in the context of co-epidemics (HIV, hepatitis C virus infection, and tuberculosis), and by developing resource allocation tools. The goal of our work is to use epidemiologic modeling to help decision makers optimize population health by providing information on the comparative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and affordability of alternative portfolio investments. Our aims are:  1. To estimate production functions that characterize the relationship between program expenditures and  health-related outcomes, such as reductions in transmission risk for prevention programs and the delivery  of services for treatment programs.  2. To develop model-based methods to translate the behavioral and biological impact of HIV-related interventions into epidemic outcomes, such as infections averted and years of life saved.  3. To determine how best to estimate health outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of HIV and  substance use interventions (for example, in the presence of co-epidemics).  4. To assess the individual- and population-level effectiveness, cost, cost-effectiveness, and budget  impact of specific interventions aimed at preventing and treating HIV and substance use and related  co-epidemics (e.g., HIV, HCV, and tuberculosis).  5. To inform the allocation of societal resources by examining the effectiveness and cost-  effectiveness of portfolios of prevention and treatment interventions in the context of the regional  epidemiology of disease.  6. To develop practical resource allocation tools for policymakers to assist them in making informed  investments of resources in HIV and substance use treatment and prevention programs. Our proposed research will develop innovative epidemiologic modeling methods for assessing portfolios of interventions; critically evaluate promising prevention and treatment interventions; advance the state of the art in HIV planning and policy modeling; and provide planners with innovative tools to assist them in informed allocation of scarce resources for HIV and substance use prevention and treatment.

There are up to 57 million amphetamine users worldwide.1 Use of meth (rapidly metabolized to amphetamine) is up to 20 times more prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM) than in the general U.S. population, and is a major contributor to the HIV epidemic.2-4 Meth use is independently associated with high-risk sexual behavior5-9 and HIV seroconversion.10-12 Effective meth treatments therefore will not only reduce meth use, they could also be important HIV prevention interventions by reducing meth-driven sexual risk.  There are no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for meth dependence, a major gap in the field, because behavioral interventions alone have limited efficacy and would likely benefit from adjunctive pharmacologic treatments.13,14 In a recent double-blind, randomized controlled trial of modest size (n=60) and limited duration (12 weeks), we discovered that compared with placebo, oral mirtazapine, an antidepressant with serotonergic and dopaminergic properties, significantly reduced meth use as determined by reduction in urine positivity in the treatment arm (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.93, p=.02).15 Sexual risk behaviors also declined significantly in the treatment arm compared to placebo. Mirtazapine decreased meth use despite low adherence: by medical event monitoring system (MEMS) caps, only 48.5% of daily doses were taken. All participants received a behavioral platform of weekly substance use counseling and monthly, brief clinician- delivered adherence counseling.  We propose expanding upon these exciting results by determining mirtazapine's efficacy at both 12 and 24 weeks with daily adherence reminders added to the above trial's behavioral platform, and determining if efficacy is sustained up to 12 weeks after drug discontinuation. A sample size of 120 will ensure greater precision of results than the original trial. The primary specific aims of this study are: (1) To determine the efficacy of mirtazapine daily vs. placebo in reducing meth use and HIV sexual risk behaviors among actively- using meth-dependent MSM from 0-12 weeks of treatment. Participants in both arms will receive the behavioral platform of in-person weekly substance use and monthly brief adherence counseling, augmented by daily text messaging adherence reminders. (2) To determine if the efficacy of mirtazapine vs. placebo is sustained from 12-24 weeks on treatment, with both arms receiving the behavioral platform.

Three cohorts of 15 mentee/mentor pairs will participate in the two-year mentorship program over the course of three years. The Cyber Mentors program will match mentees with volunteer mentors who are leaders in the field of HIV/AIDS research and who have a track record of receiving NIH-supported R01 grants. One-on-one mentoring, which will take place via phone, email, and face-to-face meetings, will have two general goals: 1) developing and implementing a career development plan focused on building the strengths of the mentee to conduct independent research, and 2) developing and submitting a high quality research funding application to NIH. Mentee/mentor pairs will be provided with up to $5,000 to support research or career development activities (e.g., preliminary data collection, attending conferences and workshops, purchasing needed research hardware and software etc.). In addition to one-on-one mentoring, mentees will participate in a sequenced series of monthly online career development seminars and quarterly online small group discussions. Monthly webinars will cover various research, methodology, and administrative topics relevant to research careers. During quarterly small group discussions, mentees will apply concepts learned during webinars to the development of their own proposals and they receive feedback on specific sections of their applications from a variety of program mentors. Mentees will participate in at least one full-scale mock review in which their grant application will be reviewe and scored by outside experts. Written feedback will be offered by reviewers with emphasis placed on recommendations for improvement. Mentees will then revise their applications in response to the mock review feedback before submitting finalized proposals to funding agencies. By the end of the two-year mentorship period, Cyber Mentors Program mentees will: (1) develop and implement a career development plan which will include six-month goals to address relative weaknesses identified during a formalized self-assessment process; (2) periodically revise six-month goals in a thoughtfully sequenced way that improves their chances of becoming an independent HIV/AIDS researcher who is competitive for obtaining grant funding; (3) identify specific funding mechanisms to support their research interests; (4) establish workable routines for writing and submitting articles to peer-reviewed journals; (5) develop networks of peers and other professionals that can be accessed for consultation; (6) draft high-quality research proposals in the area of HIV/AIDS and racial and ethnic groups that are overrepresented with HIV/AIDS; and, (7) submit their proposals to targeted NIH funding mechanisms.","5B"
2013,8410549,"5 R56 DA004334-27","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) represent a marginalized population with substantial disparities in health care access and outcomes. With improved survival due to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV has transformed into a chronic disease. In addition to HIV disease, IDUs also suffer from a syndemic of other chronic diseases including substance abuse, mental health disorders, and non-AIDS comorbidities. Proposed is a continuation of the ALIVE cohort study, among the largest, longest-running and productive IDU cohorts worldwide, and which has followed disadvantaged, primarily African American IDUs in Baltimore, MD since 1988. With advancing age and multimorbidity, the comprehensiveness of care will increasingly determine HIV-infected IDUs quality and quantity of life. We hypothesize that the key determinants of optimal HIV care (e.g., active drug use, provider relationships, social networks, neighborhood factors) may also determine effective comprehensive care for HIV-infected IDUs. While this cohort has and continues to be a platform for an array of studies all critical to addressing questions about the long-term course and consequences of HIV disease and its treatment among IDUs, this proposal emphasizes: 1) improved identification of HIV-infected IDUs most likely to respond optimally to ART. We will examine longitudinal trajectories of drug use and HIV RNA to define membership in optimal vs. sub-optimal response groups, and then quantitatively identify behavioral and clinical correlates and qualitatively examine barriers and coping mechanisms which underlie the ability to optimally respond. 2) To investigate the determinants and consequences of comprehensive care for HIV-infected IDUs from patient, clinical and societal perspectives. Comprehensive care for HIV-infected IDUs extends beyond HIV-focused aspects to include care for chronic comorbid diseases, substance abuse, and mental health conditions. We propose a framework that considers measures of effective comprehensive care from patient (perceived effectiveness), clinical (adherence to quality care indicators) and societal (service utilization) points of view. Building on prior investigation of individual-, provider-, and neighborhood-level factors associated with HAART effectiveness, we will identify determinants of quality comprehensive care. Extending our multi-level framework in this proposal, we will also evaluate the role of social networks (e.g. 'care-engaged' network members) on comprehensive care. Finally, we examine comprehensive care effectiveness in relation to patient-reported (quality-of-life), clinica (multimorbidity, physical performance) and societal (QALYs) outcomes. To achieve these aims, we continue biannual visits with interview, exam, and biospecimen collection supplemented by medical record review and registry linkage. The ALIVE study remains well-positioned to address the emerging issues confronting the healthy aging of HIV-infected IDUs, namely optimizing long-term ART and enhancing comprehensiveness of care.","1A"

Her short-term goals are to expand her experience in HIV epidemiology and prevention research among men who have sex with men (MSM), gain advanced skills in epidemiology, biostatistics, social network analysis, and qualitative research, and further the understanding of the influence of sexual networks on HIV and sexual risk behaviors among Black and White MSM. She will receive specialized training in the epidemiology of substance use and its relationship to HIV risk among MSM. Her multidisciplinary mentoring team has expertise in HIV and substance use epidemiology, prevention, and clinical research and strong track records of supporting junior faculty to become independently funded investigators. The New York Blood Center has a long history of conducting HIV epidemiology and behavioral and biomedical prevention research among MSM and is profoundly committed to the success of this K01 award. The dramatically disproportionate HIV infection rates among Black MSM in the U.S remain unexplained by differences in individual behavioral risk. One hypothesis is that the characteristics of sexual networks of Black MSM place them at increased risk of HIV compared to non-Black MSM. The purpose of this study is to directly compare the structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks between Black and White MSM and to examine the relationship of their network characteristics to HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors using an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. The proposed research will enroll a large sample of Black and White MSM (n=878) in New York City as a substudy of an NIH R01-funded study to evaluate the hypothesis that certain structural (e.g., network size, density, partner concurrency) and compositional (e.g., assortative and disassortative mixing, durability of relationships) characteristics of Black MSM sexual networks increase the men's risk of HIV infection. The specific aims of this study are the following: (1) to describe and compare the structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks between Black and White MSM at the egocentric network level, (2) to compare the association of structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks with HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors between Black and White MSM at the egocentric network level, and determine whether differences in sexual network characteristics explain the disparity in HIV prevalence between Black and White MSM, and (3) to explore in depth the contexts and meanings of sexual partnerships and networks by evaluating how Black and White MSM subjectively experience their sexual networks and perceive them to influence their sexual risk behaviors using qualitative research methods. A focus of the research is on drug and alcohol use within sexual networks and their relationship to HIV risk among MSM. This research will provide critically important information on the sexual networks of Black MSM to explain the alarming rates of HIV infection among this population and to inform development and testing of sexual network-based intervention strategies to reduce HIV acquisition and transmission risk. It will also serve as an excellent platform for the candidate to gain essential training in HIV epidemiology and prevention research and generate innovative ideas for her first R01 grant application.","1A"
2013,8410574,"5 R01 DA033150-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    HIV-1 infection and drug abuse are interlinked epidemics. Despite the recognized impact of cocaine abuse on the clinical course of HIV-1-associated neurological disorder, the mechanisms underlying the ability of cocaine to modulate central nervous system pathology remain elusive. HIV-infection in the brain can not only impair neuronal (synaptic) function and loss, but can also negatively impact neurogenesis resulting in generation of fewer adult neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Cocaine has also been shown to decrease the proliferative capacity of neural progenitors thus impairing the self-renewal ability of the hippocampus. Diminished adult neurogenesis is one of the key factors contributing to pathogenesis of NeuroAIDS. It is therefore essential to first, understand the mechanisms underlying cocaine and HIV-1 protein (Tat)-mediated impairment of NPCs and secondly, to develop therapeutic strategies that overcome the impairment of these key pool of cells. Neurogenesis is regulated by a family of neurotrophins via a wide range of signaling mechanisms. Preliminary data from our group have identified a novel factor, platelet-derived growth factor-B chain (PDGF-B) that acts as a neuroprotective agent for dopaminergic neurons both in vitro and in vivo systems. We have also demonstrated that PDGF-mediated protection of midbrain neurons involves transient receptor potential canonical channels (TRPC)-mediated entry of Ca2+. Ca2+ entry is known to play a critical role both in neuronal survival and in the proliferation of NPCs. We therefore hypothesized that HIV transactivating protein (Tat) & cocaine-mediated impairment of neurogenesis can be reversed by PDGF-B, through the action of TRPC signaling, to restore NPC proliferation and differentiation. To address this hypothesis three specific aims are proposed: 1) Examine PDGF-B-regulated reversal of impaired neurogenesis mediated by HIV Tat & cocaine in hippocampal NPCs with emphasis on TRPC channels, 2) Investigate the signaling pathways involved in PDGF-B-mediated regulation of neurogenesis, and 3) Test the therapeutic potential of Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2)-PDGF-B as an intervention strategy for ameliorating Tat & cocaine-mediated inhibition of neurogenesis in murine models of HAND. These studies are both novel and innovative in that the efficacy of PDGF-B in abrogating decreased neurogenesis can be of value not only for HAND but can be applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases as well.","2G"
2013,8410634,"1 R01 DA034547-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cocaine is a significant risk factor for contracting HIV-1 infection and subsequently developing AIDS. The proposed research is aimed to dissect the role of cocaine and HIV-associated epigenetic mechanisms in the development of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). In recent years, chromatin remodeling has emerged as an important regulatory mechanism for drug addiction and also in development of neurodegenerative disorders. In the current study, we will focus on HDAC2 since it is known to play a critical role in cognitive function by regulating the density of dendritic spines and influencing synaptic transmission in mature neurons. However, the role of HDAC2 in development of HAND is not elucidated yet in the context of cocaine. In our published and preliminary studies, we found that HIV-1 Tat protein and HIV-1 infection upregulate HDAC2 expression with concomitant downregulation of CREB and CamKIIa and 17 other genes that are known to regulate synaptic plasticity. Further we have shown for the first time that cocaine significantly upregulated HDAC2 gene expression and downregulated miR-155 and transfection with miR-155 significantly inhibited HIV infection. Accordingly, we hypothesize that cocaine acts a co-factor in neuropathogenesis of HIV infection by modulating HDAC2 expression in CNS cells leading to transcriptional repression of genes that regulate neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. The specific goals are to determine: 1) whether cocaine in association with HIV-1 virus modulates HDAC2 which in turn negatively regulates synaptic plasticity/ memory genes in primary human microglia, hippocampal neurons and astrocytes thereby contributing to the progression of HAND; 2) whether inhibition of HDAC2 reverses the effects of cocaine and HIV-1 virus on neuronal plasticity genes and dendritic spine density and 3) can delivery of HDAC2 specific siRNA and miR-155 across the in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model and in HIV-E SCID cocaine mouse model using transferrin coupled liposomal nanoformulation be explored as a therapeutic strategy for HAND. Thus, an understanding of cocaine and HIV-associated epigenetic changes and its implications in neuropathogenesis will have translational significance for therapeutic targeting and control of HAND in HIV-infected cocaine users.","2G"
2013,8410974,"1 K99 DA033878-01A1","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 infected individuals who are injecting opioid drugs show increased cognitive defects and undergo an accelerated rate of progression to AIDS. Accumulating evidence suggests that opioid drug abuse intrinsically exacerbates the pathogenesis of HIV-1. We have found that neuronal death is preceded by a prolonged period of synaptic culling, functional losses, and dendritic pathology that are presumed reversible. Importantly, opioid abuse potentiates the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 by synergistically increasing dendritic pathology (varicosity formation, beading, fragmentation, pruning), while promoting additive dendritic spine losses (plasticity). This has been verified in medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the striatum and synaptic pruning has been confirmed electron microscopically. Moreover, behavioral defects in locomotor activity are accompanied by synaptic losses and dendritic pathology in the absence of demonstrable neuron death, suggesting that sublethal neuronal injury and reduced synaptic connectivity underlie the ability of opioids to aggravate HIV-1-associated neurological disorders (HAND). While death per se is significant, the interruption of events preceding neuron death may be more strategic therapeutically. This grant will focus on the functional level of MSN by investigating the underlying physiological mechanisms of opioid +/- HIV-induced excitotoxicity. It is hypothesized that Tat induces changes in the cellular homeostasis and excitability of MSN that are exacerbated by opioid drugs through a complex sequence of events involving OR-mediated pathways. In vitro approaches are being proposed by assessing the effects of opioid drug and HIV-1 Tat-induced neurotoxicity in dissociated cortical-striatal cell cultures. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings wil be conducted in voltage- and current-clamp mode by assessing action potentials as well as sodium, potassium, AMPA, NMDA, and calcium (Ca2+) currents. The role of OR will be elucidated by applying pharmacological (OR antagonists), genetic (OR knockout mice) and silencing (silencing NMDAR) strategies to identify mechanisms underlying opioid + HIV protein interaction. To sort out whether opioids exacerbate the excitotoxic effects of Tat in the striatum via OR on MSN we will conduct experiments in vivo using two types of Cre-lox mice. Conditionally deleting OR at key sites will define the targets and associated mechanisms by which opioids exacerbate neuronal excitability (action potentials, ion channel activity, ion imaging, mitochondrial membrane potential), injury (including dendritic pathology and spine density), and behavioral defects (locomotor activity) in the striatum.","2B"
2013,8411589,"5 R21 MH095646-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is a multifactorial disease with inflammation and immune activation as prominent features that remain post-HAART. There is a critical need to identify key host factors and understand their molecular mechanisms of action contributing to HAND. Macrophages play a central role in the development of HAND. Our long-term goals are to identify key cellular pathways at the immune/CNS axis that modulate HIV-macrophage interactions which negatively impact neuronal function leading to the development of HAND. Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional cytokine-like, secreted glycophosphoprotein whose over-expression in brain, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, is associated with neurodegenerative diseases including in non-human primate models of HIV. However, no direct link of OPN to neuronal degeneration in HAND has yet been established. We identified OPN as an upregulated gene in HIV-infected macrophages. Knockdown of OPN in macrophages significantly decreases HIV replication suggesting the novel finding that OPN plays a positive role in the viral life cycle. Similar to another study, we found significantly elevated OPN levels n the CSF of HIV-infected persons with severe cognitive disorder compared to CSF from mildly demented and HIV negative control subjects. OPN was also significantly increased in brain tissue extracts from HIV-infected patients with cognitive disorder compared to unimpaired subjects. We believe that OPN, through its ability to increase monocyte recruitment into the CNS and to stimulate specific cytokine/chemokine and inflammatory pathways, plays a central role in the development of HAND. Importantly, these OPN-mediated pathways could provide new potential therapeutic targets. Our central hypothesis is that over-expression of OPN from macrophages is a host response to HIV infection that acts as a feedback loop stimulating further macrophage activation that triggers processes leading to neuronal injury and dysfunction. Two aims will test and examine this hypothesis: 1) To determine whether OPN expression is associated with neuronal degeneration in HAND and 2) To identify the molecular mechanisms by which OPN modulates HIV-1 replication.","2G"

In the first of two aims, we will use the ultrasensitive single copy assay (SCA) of viral RNA to define the presence and magnitude of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infection in a group of 'well-treated' patients and examine the impact of 'residual' CSF infection on CSF biomarkers of immunoactivation and neural injury and on neuropsychological test performance. We will also assess whether residual CSF infection relates to combination drug penetration characteristics. In the second aim, we will use sensitive single genome sequencing (SGS) methods and phylogenetic relationships to analyze the origins of viral escape and residual CSF HIV in treated patients. While antiretroviral therapy has had a remarkable impact on severe CNS HIV disease, persistent CNS infection in treated patients remains potentially important as the driver of chronic, continued CNS immunoactivation and injury, and as a viral reservoir that needs to be targeted by viral eradication strategies. The proposed studies will provide unique and essential information regarding the frequency, character and consequences of continued CNS HIV infection in 'well-treated' patients and also provide a foundation for eradication strategies targeting this infection.","6G"
2013,8411935,"5 R01 MD006198-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disproportionate rates of mental illness and HIV/AIDS/STIs among African Americans (AA), especially females, reflect significant health disparities. AA women accounted for 66% of new AIDS cases among women in 2006, and AA girls account for 64% of new HIV infections among youth. Mental health is linked to HIV-risk in important ways, yet few families- based, gender-specific, Afrocentric programs address mental health and HIV. Simultaneously targeting multiple levels in an integrated approach - the mother-daughter dyad, women, and girls - addresses HIV in the broader social context and capitalizes on the reciprocal impact of mothers and daughters, facilitating mutual reinforcement of HIV prevention attitudes and behavior, and thereby reducing intervention decay and sustaining positive outcomes over protracted time periods. IMARA (Informed, Motivated, Aware, and Responsible about AIDS) is a culturally-tailored, gender-specific, individual PLUS family-based HIV prevention program designed for two high risk groups -- AA women and AA girls. Based on the Theory of Gender and Power and the Social-Personal Framework, IMARA blends SISTA for women, SiHLE for girls, and a highly promising (Project STYLE) family-based program for teens in psychiatric care to simultaneously reduce women's and girls' risky sexual behavior and delay girls' sexual debut. IMARA incorporates components of Project STYLE that are specific to families and teens in psychiatric care (affect management, conflict resolution, parental monitoring, parent-teen communication) with aspects of SISTA and SiHLE that address gender, power, and ethnic pride. Pilot testing (N=22 mother-daughter dyads) supported IMARA's feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability, and despite the small sample size, outcome data indicate promising trends and changes in targeted mediators (increased parental monitoring, more open mother-daughter communication, greater intentions to use condoms, more relationship power) and sexual risk (increased condom use, fewer partners) separately for mothers and daughters from baseline to 2-month follow up. This study proposes a 2-arm RCT to test and compare the efficacy of IMARA to a health promotion control group in reducing risky sexual behavior among 300 women and their 14 - 18 year old AA daughters in psychiatric care. Mothers and daughters will complete baseline, 6-, and 12-month follow-up assessments. We will use an intent-to-treat analysis and a combination of SEM procedures, regression techniques, and other inferential statistical tests for contrasting means and proportions. We will analyze treatment outcomes using logistic and linear multiple regression models examining effects at 6- and 12- months separately, as well as a combined model with random effects for repeated measurements across time. This proposal answers a compelling need for innovative prevention programs that address the intersecting health disparities of mental illness and HIV/AIDS/STIs among African American girls and women. Effective family-based programs can alter negative developmental trajectories of this very high-risk population and begin to redress existing health disparities.","5A"

HIV-1 displays extraordinary genetic variations and the predominant subtype, clade B, is found in North America, Canada, Brazil, Western Europe and Australia whereas clade C is found specifically in Africa, Latin America, China, India and Nepal. Of these, clades B and C represent a large majority (>86%) of circulating HIV-1 variants and more than 56 % of the infection is with clade C. AIDS is often accompanied by immune and neuropathological abnormalities. Dopamine receptors (DRD) and transporter (DAT) are known to play a significant role in immuno-neuropathogenesis of HIV infection. Previous studies suggest that HIV-1 clade variations differentially induce the neuro-immunopathogenic mechanisms. We hypothesize that clade B and C infection exert differential effects on peripheral blood derived monocytes and central nerves system (CNS) cells leading to differential immuno-neuropathogenic effects and the mechanisms may be mediated by dysregulation of Ca2? dependent protein (CaMKs) kinases signaling pathways. Accordingly we will study (Aim #1) the effects of clade B and C virus infections on gene expression and protein modification of dopamine receptor-2 (DRD-2), dopamine transporter (DAT), rate limiting enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and level of metabolite homovalinic acid (HVA) by monocytes and primary human CNS cells (astrocytes, neurons, microglial cells), and whether (Aim #2) the mechanism of differential dysregulation of DRD-2 and DAT is mediated by modulation of Ca2?dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) and cAMP response of element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathways.","2G"

Towards this goal, I will participate in courses, workshops, seminars, and mentoring meetings to enhance my existing knowledge and research skills, and acquire new knowledge and research skills specific to the design, implementation, adaptation and evaluation of HIV/STD prevention programs for adolescents. My proposed research plan, to be conducted at Emory University and the Fulton County Department of Health and Wellness, in Atlanta, Georgia, with the guidance of my Mentors (Primary Mentor: R.

Study 1 is a mixed-method study patterned after research conducted by my Co-Mentor (Dr. Kalichman), designed to: 1) identify the proportion of African-American female adolescents exposed to an HIV intervention that do not change their condom use, and 2) describe the personal, behavioral and psychosocial factors associated with  failure to change  condom use following an HIV intervention. Data from Study 1 directly informs Study 2. In Study 2, I will adapt an existing effective gender and culturally tailored adolescent HIV intervention developed by my Mentors (Dr. DiClemente, & Dr. Wingood), to enhance its efficacy for promoting condom use among African-American female adolescents who did not change their condom use after participating in an HIV intervention. The adaptation process will be guided by a sequential and systematic adaptation model, developed by Drs. Wingood and DiClemente, to facilitate the adaptation process. Study 2 is also a pilot test of the effectiveness of the adapted SiHLE intervention for this subgroup of non-responsive adolescents. The findings from the two studies in this application will make significant contributions to our understanding of adolescent sexual risk behavior and the development of effective HIV interventions which could modify the risk trajectory for HIV acquisition in hard-to-change adolescents.","5A"
2013,8413008,"5 R21 MH096639-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smartphone technologies (i.e., cellular telephones, such as the iPhone, Android phones, and newer generation Blackberry phones), have provided a new venue for sexual partnering among men who have sex with men (MSM). Indeed, there are a rapidly growing number of smartphone applications designed to facilitate sexual partnering among MSM. Although all smartphones can access Internet sites for sexual partnering, smartphone applications designed for sexual partnering go a step further by utilizing the Global Positioning System (GPS) technology built into smartphones to help MSM identify potential partners who are geographically closest to their current position. As such, these technologies may have accelerated the rate with which men can meet and connect with sexual partners over that of the traditional Internet. Furthermore, given the expediency with which men are able to arrange sexual encounters using these applications, there is cause to question if, when, and how sexual negotiation and serostatus disclosure occurs. The overall study goal is to understand how sexual risk behaviors among MSM may be facilitated by the nature of GPS-enabled smartphone applications, the way they are used, and the process by which sexual partnering occurs via smartphone applications. We will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with 60 MSM (20 African American, 20 Latino, 20 White; 25% of whom are HIV-positive) who have utilized smartphone applications to meet sexual partners in the past 3 months. For each of the aims below, while our focus is on smartphone use, we will also collect information on their use of Internet partnering sites to use as a context for comparison and identify what might be unique to smartphone usage. The study aims are: 1. Examine how and why smartphone applications are used for sexual partnering, the situations and locations  in which they are used, in order to gain insights into how these use patterns might contribute to sexual risk  behaviors. 2. Investigate the process by which MSM use smartphone applications to find sexual partners (i.e., who they  look for, how they present themselves, how they communicate, extent of safer sex negotiation,and  disclosure) to gain insights into how this process may contribute to sexual risk behaviors. 3. Investigate the sexual and emotional states (e.g., more/less urgency, arousal, impulsivity) that MSM  experience when seeking or meeting sexual partners using smartphone applications and gain insights into  how these states may contribute to sexual risk behaviors. 4. Examine the perceived need and acceptability of a smartphone delivered intervention and assess what  MSM perceive as needed components for a smartphone-based sexual risk reduction intervention.","5A"

Several factors can affect hearing in those infected with HIV including HIV itself, secondary infections, and medications. The relative contribution of these factors is not known. We will bring together four established Dartmouth/Tanzanian resources to study hearing loss among both HIV-infected adults and children in Tanzania: 1) the DarDar Health Study, an ongoing NIH-funded study of HIV-associated tuberculosis involving Dartmouth Medical School (DMS) and the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS), which will provide a large cohort of HIV-infected adult study subjects, 2) the MUHAS ENT service, which routinely diagnoses and treats HIV-infected individuals with hearing loss, 3) the DarDar pediatric clinic, a DMS/MUHAS collaboration to diagnose and treat HIV-positive children, which follows a growing cohort of HIV-positive and HIV-affected children and 4) a laptop computer- based, hearing-testing system developed by DMS in collaboration with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for use on the International Space Station, which will be used as the field testing apparatus. This battery-powered, laptop-based device incorporates Bikisy-like tracking audiometry, distortion-product otoacoustic emission testing, probe placement verification, in-ear noise level measurement, and a gap detection test. It is ideally suited for assessing hearing loss in resource-limited environments. A computer-based, Kiswahili questionnaire that covers hearing symptoms and noise exposure will be added to the system to provide a robust system for performing complete hearing evaluations efficiently. Using this system we will determine the frequency of abnormal central and peripheral hearing test results in both adults and children by performing a cross-sectional prevalence study in Tanzania among HIV-positive subjects receiving and not receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART), HIV-positive subjects with and without prior treatment for TB, and HIV-negative controls. We will also assess the incidence of new hearing loss and the quantitative contributions of HIV severity, ART duration and specific TB treatment regimens to hearing loss in a longitudinal study among HIV-positive and HIV-negative subjects. African-made hearing aids with solar battery chargers will be provided to those subjects with significant hearing loss that would benefit from hearing augmentation. Collectively, these studies will: (1) provide the first comprehensive data on hearing loss among HIV-positive adults and children living in a resource poor setting, (2) provide information on the prevalence, incidence and nature (central vs. peripheral) of the hearing loss in HIV-positive subjects, (3) determine associations between hearing loss, ART and TB treatment, and (4) permit the development of guidelines for monitoring high-risk subjects and intervening with appropriate treatment and hearing augmentation.","1B"

HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a central and characteristic enzyme of retroviruses, and is the target of many key anti-AIDS drugs. RT possesses two enzymatic activities, a DNA polymerase and a ribonuclease H (RNH). Although RT utilizes both DNA polymerase and RNH activities to carry out synthesis, to date, all RT inhibitors that have been approved for clinical use target the polymerase activity, not the RNH activity. Given the virus' ability to mutate and become drug resistant, it is crucial to explore RN inhibitors as potential anti-AIDS therapeutic agents. Though several RNH inhibitors have been found to inhibit RNH activity, visualization of inhibitor binding mechanisms could drive structure-based design of more effective antiviral drugs. The project goals are designed in order to provide training in the field of X-ray crystallography and utilize those skills in discovery and design of novel inhibitors of HIV-1 RT. The first goal will be to use X-ray crystallography to determine the structures of both active site and allosteric RNH inhibitors bound to HIV-1 RT and establish structure-activity relationships and detailed binding modes. In an effort toward the discovery of novel chemical classes of RNH inhibitors, a library of 1500 drug-like fragments will be analyzed for potential binding to HIV-1 RT using surface plasmon resonance and X-ray crystallography, and for RNH inhibition using a fluorescence based high throughput screen that looks specifically for RNA cleavage. The fragment screening approach allows for efficient search of chemical space and should lead to the identification of novel scaffolds for inhibiting HIV-1 RNH activity at both the active site and allosteric pockets.","7A"

The CTU will be affiliated with the Vaccine Network and represents a continuation of the highly successful Harvard HVTU which has been the lead enrolling unit in the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) for the past three years, which maintains consistently high scores in the Network Evaluation System, and whose members play important leadership roles in the HVTN.    The CTU will be led by highly experienced clinical investigators in the field of HIV vaccines who have collaborated effectively for the past five years. Dr. Raphael Dolin will serve as Principal Investigator (PI) for the CTU, and Drs. Lindsey Baden and Kenneth Mayer will serve as CRS site-PIs for BWH and FCH respectively. Dr. Dolin will also oversee the supporting laboratory at BIDMC.    The collaboration among the components of the proposed CTU takes advantage of the special strengths of each site and results in a synergy of activities toward the goals of the Vaccine Trials Network. The BWH CRS is a university-based site with strong ties to local college populations, medical center employees, and has broad-based research programs. FCH is a community-based health center with strong ties to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender communities and with well developed relationships with communities of underrepresented minorities. The laboratory at BIDMC has well-established sample processing procedures and also has other highly developed HIV laboratory capabilities.    The CTU and its component CRSs are fully established to carry out the broad spectrum of activities required by the Network. These activities are fully integrated under the guidance of the CTU, and include community outreach, recruitment, and education programs, a single community advisory board (CAB), a single common pharmacy, centralized sample processing, and coordinated quality management. Common standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been developed through the Harvard HVTU for both CRS sites.    While this Unit has participated in a broad spectrum of HIV vaccine trials, the CTU has particular interest in studies of adenovirus vectors, novel adjuvants, and mucosal immunity.

This knowledge is essential to develop and test protein, somatic cell gene, and stem cell therapies for human genetic diseases. The full scope of understanding the pathogenesis of these disorders and testing therapy cannot be realized without authentic (gene-homologous, orthologous) animal models for the studies that are not possible for ethical and practical reasons in human patients. Gene knockout technology in mice has provided a valuable source, but additional models are needed for studies requiring long-lived animals of larger size and diverse genetic background to be able to monitor efficacy and safety long-term. A reservoir of such diseases is present in existing dog and cat breeds that are relatively inbred but that retain genetic heterogeneity similar to that present in the Old Order Amish and Ashkenazi Jewish populations. The objective of this grant is to continue to serve as a National and International Referral Center to identify, characterize, verify, preserve, and make available for research new and existing large animal models of human genetic disease. These models involve defects in homologous gene loci having the same molecular and clinical phenotypes as in human patients. Models offering new opportunities to investigate disease pathogenesis and approaches to therapy will be emphasized in consultation with an Advisory Committee. The Center will provide the clinical, pathological, and molecular genetic studies required to discover important large animal models, including, as a new direction, those with complex inheritance, and establish their homology with the human disorder. Verified models will be made available to other investigators for a nominal fee-for-service in the form of DNA, cells, frozen semen, and breeding stock. We will also serve as a resource for normal dogs and cats and their tissues, and we will continue to offer a facility and expertise for investigators to perform pathogenetic and therapy experiments in dog and cat models on a Program Income Fund, fee-for-service basis.","2E"

This proposed mixed-method study will use the Social Cognitive Theory and the Social Ecological Model to fill this critical gap. The following three research aims seek to look beyond the individual and consider environmental contextual factors: Aim 1: Using qualitative methods, examine and compare the processes through which male: female sex ratios influence sexual networks and partnership formation and maintenance among heterosexual African-American women living in two types of census tracts: a tract that has higher male incarceration rates and a tract that has lower male incarceration rates; Aim 2: Investigate the relationship between male incarceration rates and rates of HIV and other STIs in Atlanta census tracts over time (2005- 2010); Aim 3: Explore health care service availability as a moderator of the relationship between rates of male incarceration and rates of HIV and other STIs. The long term objective of this study is to gain a greater understanding of how male incarceration rates and the health care service environment influence individuallevel sexual and reproductive health. The information gained by achieving the aims of this study could be used to inform the development of programs and policies aimed at mitigating the adverse impact of rates of male incarceration on the transmission of HIV and other STIs.  The principal investigator (hereafter PI) will use qualitative methods to achieve Aim 1 and quantitative methods to achieve Aims 2 and 3. Qualitative methods are best suited to address Aim 1 because these methods are particularly useful for understanding contextual influences and also for discovery,[3-5] both of which are important for emerging research on the macro-social determinants of STIs and HIV. The PI will interview women from two Atlanta, GA census tracts, one that has a high male incarceration rate and a low male: female sex ratio, and the other that has a low male incarceration rate and a male: female sex ratio close to 1.00. Interviews will focus on sexual networks and romantic partnership formation and maintenance. To achieve Aims 2 and 3, U.S. decennial data, STI and HIV/AIDS surveillance data, incarceration data and an inventory of health care service locations will be used to analyze the relationship between incarceration rates and STI/HIV rates in Atlanta GA census tracts, and to investigate whether spatial access to healthcare moderates these relationships. Geographic Information Software (GIS), PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS) and Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) software will be used in these analyses.","7A"

The objectives of the current proposal are to define viral evolutionary steps within the central nervous system (CNS) and select monocyte/macrophages from bone marrow, gut, lung and blood preceding and associated with the onset of neuropathogenesis. The Rhesus macaque model of neuroAIDS will be employed to study the evolution of the viral quasispecies during disease progression and to track SIV-infected macrophage subsets infiltrating the brain. 24 animals will be infected with a genetically-defined viral swarm. Peripheral blood and tissue samples will be collected over time and used for amplification of a 3.3kb fragment, including gp160, nef and 5' LTR, of the viral genome, as well as some full-length genomes from selected tissues. We will use laser-captured microscopy to isolate viral variants from specific productively infected macrophage in the brain at early and end stage disease. High-resolution phylogenetic, population genetics, and molecular clock algorithms (phylodynamics) will reveal genetic aspects of viral reservoirs linked to the onset of a neuropathogenic infection that have not yet been characterized because of ethical problems associated with tissue sampling in humans. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the evolutionary dynamics of SIV in lymphoid and non- lymphoid tissues during the course of the infection via longitudinal PBMC/tissue macrophages sampling and brain biopsies of monkeys with and without CD8+ T-cell depletion; Specific Aim 2 will identify macrophage subsets involved in brain entry and acting as potential viral reservoirs for brain infection. We will be able to identify tempo and mode of brain infection and evolutionary signatures leading to the emergence of infectious macrophage-tropic quasispecies that could be used to predict and monitor the disease. Equally important is the possibility to use the findings into developing drugs that target macrophage and viral quasispecies associated to neuropathogenesis. Overall, we will compile the most comprehensive database of longitudinal SIV sequences from a variety of tissues to date. The PI, although a new investigator without previous R01 funding, has significant experience in cutting-edge analysis of genetic data, and has assembled a unique and qualified interdisciplinary team to assist in the study.","1A,1B,2G"
2013,8414163,"5 R01 MH091875-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Twenty-four US states have HIV-specific criminal laws that require persons living with HIV to disclose their positive serostatus to prospective sex partners. Moreover, lawmakers in US states without these laws regularly propose such legislation. Although the presumptive purpose of the laws is to increase serostatus disclosure to sexual partners (with the assumption that informed partners will abstain or practice safer sex), little is known about their effectiveness. Even less is known about the potential negative effects of the laws, which range from discouraging HIV testing and undermining central HIV prevention messages to fostering increased HIV-related stigma and deterring (rather than promoting) seropositive status disclosure by increasing the potential negative consequences of disclosing one's HIV-positive status. US HIV disclosure laws also take several different forms, which introduces further variability and additional statute-specific concerns.  Only one empirical study has directly assessed the effects of US HIV disclosure laws on persons living with HIV. The study was conducted in Michigan, a state with an HIV disclosure law, by the PI of the proposed project. No direct empirical studies have examined the impact of the laws on HIV-negative or serostatus unknown persons at risk for HIV infection. The proposed project will expand our successful preliminary study on HIV disclosure laws. We will survey statewide samples of 400 persons living with HIV and 200 persons at risk for the infection in each of four US states, three with different versions of HIV disclosure laws and one with no law. Results from the study will determine positive and negative effects of the laws on HIV-positive and HIV- negative, at-risk individuals. Comparison of states with differing laws has the further potential to determine which aspects of criminal disclosure laws are useful in terms of promoting the intended outcome (safer sex behavior within sero-discordant couples, or sexual abstinence) and which aspects have unintended negative consequences. The results of the study will inform HIV-related legislation, which is often drafted without the benefit of scientific evidence. Results will also inform policy discussions on the role of the criminal law in disease containment efforts.","5C"

There has also been a growing interest in promising intervention approaches that target structural and socio-ecological level factors, yet there is little shared theoretical understanding of what constitutes a  structural intervention . As well, many scientific studies published in the peer reviewed literature use common terms for intervention approaches, yet often implement programs very differently. In this proposed study we will systematically review and meta-analyze the impact of 15 key HIV behavioral interventions, and conduct updates on systematic reviews and meta-analyses on 12 additional interventions we have done previously. In addition, intervention case studies will be initiated for those intervention topics listed above in which there is evidence of a lack of consistency across investigators in how they are defining and implementing the intervention.

2013,8414166,"5 R01 MH086322-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Worldwide data suggest that migrants are at increased risk of HIV infection. The high rates of HIV infection and the mobility of migrant populations make migrants a living bridge to spread the AIDS virus between the countries/places of origin and the countries/places of destination. Research findings indicate that the increased HIV infection among migrants is associated their high prevalence of HIV risk behaviors (substance use and risky sex), which in turn, are determined by socioenvironmental and situational factors. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which environmental factors lead to HIV risk behavior. Guided by the Social Capital Theory, in this project, we propose to test two hypothesized mechanisms that may link social influences to HIV risk behavior among migrants - the lack of social support (including informational, instrumental and emotional) and the weakening of informal social control (including collective efficacy and normative beliefs). Rural migrants lost their social capital (defined as durable, resource-rich, trustworthy, and reciprocal network connections a person accumulated) deeply rooted in the place of rural origin and they may experience difficulties rebuilding social capital in the urban destination due to their low socioeconomic status. Migrants with limited social capital may then experience difficulties obtaining informational, instrumental, and emotional support to establish their career and life in the stressful urban settings; consequently use of substance becomes an attractive and convenient option. The lack of social capital may also make migrants less responsive to the social capital-based collective efficacy (volunteer actions by community members against deviate behaviors that may devalue the community), increasing the likelihood to engage in sexual risk behavior. When rebuilding social capital, migrants may adopt more liberal attitudes and more open values about sex, leading to sexual risk behavior. Exposure to more opportunities in urban settings will further exacerbate the likelihood. The low SES of female migrants may explain the higher HIV risk among them than among their male counterparts. The unprecedented rural-to-urban migration in China with the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic and the high prevalence of HIV risk behavior among rural migrants provide a window opportunity to investigate these issues. We will conduct the proposed research in Wuhan, China, a metropolitan city and provincial capital with a population of 8.1 million and one million rural migrants. The proposed research is highly significant and very innovative. Data for the proposed research will be collected using probability samples. The study samples will be selected using cost-effective methods supported by the GIS/GPS technology and a sample of 1200 rural migrants will be contrasted with the same number of non- migrant residents in the rural areas from where rural migrants originate and non-migrant residents in the urban areas where the rural migrants are currently living and working. In addition to survey data, sexually transmitted infections will also be assessed. We expected that findings from this research will advance our understanding of the migration-related HIV/AIDS transmission and provide needed data supporting our next step of research - devising and implementing innovative programs for HIV prevention.","5B"
2013,8414167,"5 R01 MH090326-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART) can only be achieved through timely HIV diagnosis, successful linkage to care, and treatment initiation. In South Africa, however, only a fraction of those newly diagnosed with HIV enter HIV care. The period after HIV testing but prior to ART initiation represents a time of very high mortality, fueled by the tuberculosis (TB) epidemic, and therefore a time when improving access to TB screening and HIV care would be of substantial benefit. Though TB is the leading cause death among those with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, less than one-third of HIV-infected South Africans have been screened for TB. Efforts are urgently needed to implement and evaluate strategies that improve early diagnosis and linkage to HIV and TB care, and to consider such strategies in the context of constrained healthcare resources. We propose two specific aims. The first aim is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to establish the efficacy of a health system navigator intervention in improving linkage to HIV and TB care among newly diagnosed HIV-infected outpatients in Durban, South Africa. Using Andersen's model of health service utilization as a theoretical framework, we will provide a health system navigator to help patients identify and overcome barriers to care and we will examine the intersection of contextual and patient-level factors that affect linkage to care. The second aim is to evaluate the cost and cost-effectiveness of this intervention for promoting linkage to HIV and TB care at the time of HIV screening. The 2010 Trans-NIH Plan for HIV-related research prioritizes the assessment of outcomes related to TB and HIV care integration on survival, quality of care, and cost, as well as the impact of different approaches for testing, linkage, and retention in care in improving outcomes of HIV disease. The proposed study will address several of these important issues through collaboration among medical, behavioral and cost- effectiveness experts working in the US and the South African province with the highest prevalence of HIV and TB. The results will inform HIV and TB care in South Africa and in other resource-limited settings.","5C"

2013,8414425,"5 R01 MH089722-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are 2.5 million children living the HIV/AIDS worldwide. Most live in resource- limited settings. Treatment guidelines for children are often based on findings in adults and seldom assembled from studies employing a randomized design. This rationale led the NIH to initiate the PREDICT study underway in Thailand and Cambodia. PREDICT uses a randomized design to determine the optimal timing of antiretroviral initiation in children. International guidelines for ART initiation in children older than 12 months continue to recommend deferring therapy until symptomatic disease or immune compromise occurs, despite studies in younger infants (CHER trial) identifying a benefit for early treatment. Treatment outcomes for older children are needed and neurodevelopmental outcomes could critically inform guidelines. This proposal will add robust neurodevelopmental and imaging outcomes to PREDICT. This work will extend our current limited evaluation of neurodevelopmental outcomes to determine if differences in long-term neuropsychological and neurological outcomes exist in relation to deferring antiretroviral therapy. We will also enroll needed HIV-negative comparative groups of HIV-exposed and unexposed children. Since microencephaly is a common manifestation of HIV in children, volumetric analyses may be most informative. Should the primary findings from PREDICT fail to identify differences by randomized group (immediate compared to deferred therapy), findings from the proposed work may have an enormous impact by informing treatment guidelines worldwide.","2G"
2013,8414428,"5 R01 AI091550-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the mid-1990's, modeling of viral decay predicted that antiretroviral therapy (ART) would result in clearance of HIV infection with ~3 years of treatment. However, HIV was found to persist during suppressive ART. The half-life of infection was estimated to extend for many years, such that viral clearance would not be expected to occur during a normal life span. Our and others' studies of HIV that persists during suppressive ART have observed low-level viral replication in a minority (~20%) of individuals. We have studied HIV persisting in blood, sputum and genital tissues, all of which could serve as potential viral reservoirs during effective ART. Utilizing single genome amplification (SGA), we independently-derived and directly sequenced (to avoid detection of PCR-mediated mutations) sufficient viral templates from multiple specimens to characterize viral populations and their changes during suppressive ART. We detected sizable populations of identical viral genomes, here termed monotypic virus, in various cell types. SGA of low-level plasma viral blips (<500c/mL) revealed monotypic viruses in individuals that phylogenetic and drug resistance analyses showed no evidence of viral replication. We reason that blips of monotypic virus could result from production of virions without full- cycles of replication, as nucleoside- and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI and NNRTI) would prevent infection of additional cells. As estimates of viral burst size suggest that a single HIV infected cell could not produce sufficient virions to generate a viral load of 50-500c/mL, this gave further support to a developing hypothesis that HIV proviruses are amplified in proliferating cells, and that at times these cells produce virions without full rounds of infection. If our hypothesis is correct, cellular proliferation could be an important mechanism that over time perpetuates HIV infection, a concept that has not been previously characterized. The hypotheses of this proposal are that: (1) Clonal expansion (i.e., proliferation) of HIV infected cells results in multiple cells, each with an identical viral sequence integrated at the same site in the host's genome. (2) A substantial proportion of viruses detected in the female genital mucosa and blood are derived from the proliferation of HIV infected cells, and these viruses become more prominent during suppressive ART. (3) Monotypic proviral sequences include templates that are replication competent. We Aim to:  1: Determine if monotypic (identical) HIV env sequences in the uterine cervix result from proliferation of infected cells or from bursts of viral replication  2: Determine if whole monotypic HIV genomes include replication competent viruses Our proposed studies exploring the role of cellular proliferation in perpetuating HIV infection could alter current paradigms explaining viral persistence and shape interventions needed to cure HIV.","2B"
2013,8414429,"5 R01 AI087135-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Estimation Methods for Nonlinear ODE Models in AIDS Research  Abstract In this project we propose identifiability methods and statistical estimation methods for ordinary differential equation (ODE) models to support HIV/AIDS research. Although many mathematical models and statistical methods have been developed for epidemiological and clinical studies in AIDS research, very few identifiability and estimation methods are developed for nonlinear ODE models which are widely used in AIDS research. It is challenging to estimate the parameters in the ODE models when no closed-form solution is available for nonlinear ODEs. Very few formal statistical estimation methods are available for ODE models. To fill this gap, in this project we propose novel statistical estimation methods for nonlinear ODE models derived from HIV/AIDS research. In particular, we propose four specific aims: 1) Integrate parameter identifiability techniques from different research disciplines to address the identifiability issues for ordinary differential equation (ODE) models; 2) Develop novel statistical estimation methods for ODE models and study the asymptotic and finite-sample properties of the estimators; 3) Evaluate the new methods by comparing them to the existing methods based on theoretical perspective, finite sample properties and computational efficiency, and test and validate the proposed methods using the examples and data from studies of immune response to viral infections; 4) Develop efficient computational algorithms and user-friendly software packages to implement the proposed methods. We propose several novel estimation methods including sieve-based methods for estimating both constant and time-varying parameters, penalized kernel estimation methods and numerical algorithm-based regression approaches for ODE models. The model identifiability analysis for ODE models is also relatively innovative from statistical perspective. To achieve our aims, we have formed a strong interdisciplinary research team consisting of statisticians, computational scientists and software developers with necessary expertise for this project. The differential equation models are often developed based on mechanisms of biomedical systems. The model parameters usually have meaningful biological interpretations and are important in their own rights. It is very important to reliably estimate these model parameters from experimental data. The estimation results may help HIV/AIDS investigators better understand the biological mechanisms and pathogenesis of HIV infection, which may lead to novel scientific findings and provide guidance to develop treatment strategies.","1C"
2013,8414435,"5 R01 AI093258-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application will seek to better understand the mechanism by which the TRIM5alpha protein from rhesus macaques (rhTRIM5alpha) inhibits HIV-1 infection by defining the molecular and cellular biology of rhTRIM5alpha during restriction. We have identified a number of cellular proteins that associate with TRIM5alpha in cells. We have also developed powerful new methods to quantitatively characterize the association of TRIM5alpha with these cellular proteins. In the first aim, we will examine the connection between the ability of rhTRIM5alpha to self-associate and restrict retroviral infection. Specifically, we will characterize the effects of specific rhTRIM5alpha variants that have lost the ability to localize to cytoplasmic bodies due to specific mutations we have introduced into the linker2 region of the protein. We will identify the determinants in this region that mediate ability of rhTRIM5alpha to self-associate, measuring this ability with a novel, imaging based self-association assay we have recently developed. We will utilize the knowledge generated in these studies to develop rhTRIM5alpha variants with increased ability to restrict HIV-1 infection. In the second aim, we will define the role of the protein p62/sequestosome1 in regulating the degradation of TRIM5alpha. The known biological function of this protein, a scaffolding protein that mediates the shuttling of ubiquitylated cargo proteins to the proteasome, makes it an interesting candidate to play a role in the biology of TRIM5alpha mediated retroviral restriction. We will test the hypothesis that p62 conditionally regulates the ability of different cellular degradative pathways to degrade TRIM5alpha. In the third aim, we will use quantitative imaging methods to define the events that occur in cells when restriction sensitive virions enter the cytoplasm of target cells. By monitoring the presence of biologically relevant cellular proteins in TRIM5alpha cytoplasmic bodies during restriction, we will be able g restriction, we will be able to dissect and develop an understanding of this critical biological process.","2B"
2013,8414436,"5 R01 AI081625-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well-established that NAbs emerge in most patients within a few months following HIV infection and that the NAbs developed by individual patients primarily target the autologous virus. However HIV+ sera can also neutralize heterologous isolates (cross-neutralizing antibody responses). The epitope-specificity of these cross-neutralizing antibody responses is largely unknown. We examined HIV+ antiretroviral-naive patients and identified a small number of subjects that developed broad anti-HIV plasma cross-neutralizing antibody responses. The plasma of one patient neutralizes all isolated tested against, irrespective of clade. Epitope- mapping analysis indicated that the exceptionally broad plasma neutralizing activity of that subject is exclusively due to anti-CD4-BS antibodies. However, because most patients, irrespective of the breadth of their plasma cross-neutralizing antibody responses, develop anti- CD4-BS antibodies, we hypothesize that the epitope(s) recognized by that patient's anti-CD4- BS antibodies differ from those recognized by the anti-CD4-BS antibodies of most HIV+- patients. We propose to isolate and characterize anti-CD4-BS MAbs from that patient and also to examine how the virus manages to escape their action. We have also identified another patient that developed 4E10-like and 2F5-like antibodies. We propose to map the precise epitope of these antibodies and examine the viral determinants of escape from those antibodies in that patient. In most cases, however, we were unable to map the epitope-specificities of broad plasma cross-neutralizing antibody responses to a particular epitope on Env. Our proposed studies aim at identifying the epitopes recognized by broadly cross-reactive NAbs developed during natural HIV-infection. This analysis will provide insights into the pathways that lead to the development of cross-reactive NAbs during HIV-infection, their epitopes, and the determinants of viral-escape from broadly-cross-reactive NAbs. Information from such studies can be used to develop more effective immunogens.","4A"

2013,8414796,"4 R01 AI087915-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), has infected one third of the world's population. Infection occurs when the pathogen is inhaled, following exposure to a patient with lung TB. 10% of infected persons progress to disease, while 90% never do. We don't understand why some people develop disease, while others do not: this is the focus of this application.  To address protection against TB, we have established a cohort of 6,363 South African adolescents. 53% were infected with M.tb at baseline. During 2 years of follow-up, 76 of these participants developed TB disease. As blood was collected and stored every 6 months, we have a unique opportunity to compare host responses between adolescents who developed disease and those who have remained healthy.  We will have two approaches to defining protection. Our first focus will be on T cells, which are immune cells shown to be critical for protection against TB. Current assays focus on limited aspects of the T cell response, but have not been successful in defining protection. We have devised a new paradigm - we hypothesize that a model including multiple T cell functional attributes plus their regulation by multiple immune cells will define protection. We propose that relative  immune quiescence , i.e., an optimal but relatively silent immune response, is associated with protection. We and others have preliminary data to suggest that too much inflammation, or too much activation of the immune system, may be detrimental.  The rationale for our second focus is that our knowledge of host control of M.tb infection remains incomplete - we therefore propose an unbiased approach that will facilitate discovery of novel pathways involved in protection. We will assess genome-wide gene expression in blood cells, including purified immune cell populations, to delineate new pathways involved in protection. Our preliminary studies of protection against TB in infants have shown the incredible power of this approach.  The longitudinal nature of the adolescent cohort, and state-of-the-art bioinformatic approaches, afford unique muscle for uncovering host determinants of protection. We will immediately validate findings by studying further groups of adolescents, from the same cohort. This will be followed by mechanistic studies aimed at understanding how newly described markers may act to protect us against TB.  Knowledge of host determinants of protection against TB disease could impact TB control in many ways. For example, targeted prophylactic therapy for infected persons could be implemented, as well as rapid clinical testing of novel TB vaccines. Knowledge gained will also stimulate development of new vaccines and drugs against TB.","2B,2D"

The first international grant awarded to NARI in September 1992 was  Preparation for AIDS Vaccine Evaluation  (PAVE). This was followed by an NIH sponsored grant, viz., HIV Network for Prevention Trials (HIVNET) from November 1994. The HIVNET project was the largest, comprehensive epidemiological study of risk factors for HIV transmission in India and provided the first estimates of HIV incidence as well as the first documentation of clinical features of acute sero-conversion. The same site infrastructure was used for studies in acute sero-converters from 1997-1999 under a RO1 funded grant, which aimed at a more comprehensive follow-up of sero-converters and p24 antigenic individuals to study the immunopathogenesis of acute HIV infection. With initial focus on descriptive epidemiology and basic research, NARI is currently involved in clinical trials and applied research. The first clinical trial was carried out in 1998 and since then NARI has been participating in clinical trials funded by severa international and national organizations. NARI became a part of HPTN (034, 047, 052, 059 studies), ACTG (5175, 5185, 5190, 5199 studies) and vaccine trial networks (HVTN and IAVI).

Addressing these Priority Areas will be accomplished through utilization of the A-CTU's genuine partnership with the patient/participant community, its experience in NIAID and industry-funded clinical trials, and through collaborative research among clinical and basic science investigators within the UAB CFAR.","3D,3F,4D,4E,6B,6C,6D,6E,6J"
2013,8414819,"5 R01 AI049104-12","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We know much about HIV transcription and replication. During the past two decades, the roles played by basal transcription complexes, NF-kB and Tat in initiation and elongation of viral transcription have been placed on solid scientific foundation. In addition, the co-activator of NF-kB and the viral transactivator Tat, the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), has been demonstrated to phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), Spt5 from DSIF and RD from NELF, thus allowing transcription complexes to elongate. P-TEFb itself is under exquisite control in cells, which determines their state of differentiation and proliferation. At least three additional cyclin dependent kinases play a critical role in co- transcriptional processing of HIV RNA, namely Cdk11, 12 and 13, some of which affect 3' end formation (Cdk11) and others the complex splicing of viral transcripts (Cdk12/Cdk13). Recently, we found that the latter two bind CycK, which was thought previously to be another component of P-TEFb. Importantly, CycK does not bind Cdk9, which together with CycT1 or CycT2 forms P-TEFb. This proposal will address in intricate detail how Tat interferes with the formation of inactive P-TEFb complexes in cells, how certain inhibitors of histone deacetylases do the same and how these new CycK complexes affect the splicing of HIV transcripts. In the process, we will have learned how Tat sustains optimal viral replication in infected cells, how drugs such as HMBA, SAHA and specific HDACis perturb the metabolism of P-TEFb and how these new CycK:Cdk complexes affect RNAPII as well as alternative splicing factors. New targets for inhibiting HIV replication will be revealed together with candidate compounds that should find future clinical utility.","2B"
2013,8414821,"5 R01 AI081651-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Symptoms of T-cell hyperactivation shape the course and outcome of HIV-1 infection, but the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this chronic immune activation are not well understood. We have identified a novel mechanism by which the HIV-1 Tat protein leads to chronic immune activation. We find that Tat hyperactivates T cells by blocking the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 (Kwon et al, Cell Host Microbe, 2008). SIRT1 is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent histone deacetylase and an important regulator of the transcription factor NF-B. Tat directly interacts with the deacetylase domain of SIRT1 and blocks the ability of SIRT1 to deacetylate the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-B. Because acetylated p65 is more active as a transcription factor, Tat hyperactivates the expression of NF-B-responsive genes, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2). These results support a model where the normal function of SIRT1 as a negative regulator of T-cell activation is suppressed by Tat during HIV infection. We propose to define the novel role of SIRT1 as a regulator of immune activation in HIV-infected T cells. We have new and unpublished findings that link the SIRT1 deacetylase activity with immune-suppressive functions of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Special focus of this proposal lies therefore on the characterization of the function of Tat and SIRT1 in Tregs and on the identification of novel SIRT1 substrates in effector and regulatory T cells populations. The importance of these studies is highlighted by their possible impact on the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Potent small molecule activators of SIRT1 have recently become available with great promise in diseases associated with aging (Milne et al, Nature, 2007). We will use these activators to test the hypothesis that activating the suppressor function of SIRT1 will counterbalance the immune stimulatory function of Tat and may represent a novel strategy to treat chronic immune activation in HIV-infected patients. Our specific aims are: 1) we will study the role of SIRT1 in HIV-infected T cells. We will infect Jurkat T cell lines in which SIRT1 expression is down regulated via shRNAs with a GFP-tagged infectious clone of HIV-1 and study intracellular IL-2 production in infected (GFP+) and uninfected (GFP-) cells in response to activation with anti-CD3 and CD28 antibodies. We will also infect primary CD4+ T cell cultures with HIV-1 and test whether treatment with SIRT1 activators can reverse hyperstimulation of IL-2 production. 2) We will identify novel targets of the SIRT1 deacetylase activity in infected T cells. We have preliminary evidence that Tat by inhibiting SIRT1 induces hyperacetylation of several SIRT1 targets including proapoptotic factors p53 and Foxo3A. Since both factors are important regulators of T-cell death during HIV infection, we will study how Tat manipulates the transcriptional activities and proapoptotic functions of both factors. We will also perform genome-wide expression profiling and identify gene programs that are modulated by Tat expression or SIRT1 knockdown. 3) We will examine how the SIRT1/Tat interaction influences the development and function of Tregs. We have preliminary results showing that SIRT1 promotes TGF--induced Treg development and is involved in deacetylation of the transcription factor FoxP3. We propose to study how SIRT1 regulates expression and function of FoxP3 in Tregs and will characterize how Tat expression during HIV infection can interfere with this process. These studies will bring novel insight into the molecular biology of HIV-induced immune activation and identify yet undefined mechanisms of HDAC-mediated control of the immune response.","2C"

The 5 Specific Aims of this extended project have remained the same with some refinements described in the Progress Report and Research Plan sections. The revised Aims are: Specific Aim 1. Map MHC class Tepitopes that stimulate production of inflammatory or fibrogenic mediators by virus-specific CD8+ T cells and compare their susceptibility to immune selection pressure. Specific Aim 2. Determine if intrahepatic CD8+ T cells express inhibitory molecules with the potentialto alter effector functions and assess how they are maintainedin the persistently infected liver. Specific Aim 3. Compare the repertoire and frequency of intrahepatic HCV-specific CD4+ T cells in chronic and resolved infections, and determine if they function to suppress immunity or drive liver disease. Specific Aim 4. Superinfect persistently viremic chimpanzees with wild-type HCV to test directly the in situ responsiveness of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Assess the potential to rescue HCV-specific T cells inchronic hepatitis C by immunotherapeutic intervention. Specific Aim 5. Determine protective immunity mechanismsin HBV vaccinated and infected chimpanzees.

2013,8414836,"5 R01 AI087746-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current therapy for patients with chronic HCV infection includes high doses of IFN in combination with ribavirin. However, success rates remain low (around 50% of treated patients depending on genotype). Furthermore, the IFN/ribavirin treatment carries a significant risk of serious side effects. Thus, the development of alternative treatments is essential. The immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A (CsA) was reported to be clinically effective against HCV infection. Moreover, recent studies provided evidence that non- immunosuppressive CsA analogs such as NIM811, Debio 025 and SCY-635 inhibit HCV RNA replication both in vitro and in vivo in an IFN-independent manner. A growing body of evidence suggests that cyclophilins (Cyps) are important for the HCV life cycle, suggesting that Cyp inhibitors (CsA, Debio 025, NIM811 or SCY- 635), by acting on intracellular Cyps, block HCV replication. Three independent studies recently demonstrated that HCV highly relies on cyclophilin A (CypA) to replicate in human hepatocytes. We showed that CypA, but not CypB, CypC and CypD, is critical for HCV replication. We demonstrated that the hydrophobic pocket of CypA, where Cyp inhibitors bind, and which control the isomerase activity of CypA, is critical for HCV replication. We obtained several lines of evidence that a population of CypA molecules resides in a protease- resistant membrane compartment similar to that where HCV replicates. We also found that the association of CypA with this compartment does not depend on the presence of HCV proteins. Importantly, we showed that Cyp inhibitors deplete this membrane compartment of CypA. The depletion of CypA from the protected ER spherules where HCV replication occurs, may provide the first hint for the mechanism of antiviral action of Cyp inhibitors. However, the molecular requirements for CypA in HCV replication as well as the antiviral mechanisms of action of this novel class of potent anti-HCV agents - the Cyp inhibitors - are completely obscure. By selecting Cyp inhibitor-resistant HCV mutant's in vitro, studies mapped mutations into two nonstructural (NS) proteins - NS5A and NS5B. Altogether these data suggest the existence of a relationship between CypA, NS5A and NS5B that is critical for HCV replication. To test this hypothesis, we propose in this application to conduct a set of experiments aimed at fully characterizing CypA-NS5A-NS5B interactions at a molecular level; analyzing the development of HCV resistance to Cyp inhibitors; and investigating the effect of Cyp inhibitors on the composition and polymerase activities of HCV replication complexes. The ultimate goal of this application is to improve our understanding of the role of CypA in the HCV life cycle and of the in vitro and in vivo block mediated by this novel class of potent anti-HCV agents - the Cyp inhibitors.","6D"

2013,8414876,"7 R01 AI087734-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory viral infections are the third leading cause of death worldwide and are a WHO priority for vaccine development. For many years the scientific community has focused enormous efforts on the development of therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines that elicit CD8 T cell responses with the promise that such interventions will be sufficient to confer protective effects and potentially offset any deficiency in the antibody arm of the anti- viral response. However, to date the development of effective T cell vaccines against respiratory viruses remains elusive. For safety reasons, most vaccination strategies use replication-incompetent, or replication competent highly attenuated, viral vectors. However, there is considerable literature acknowledging that strongly replicating viruses are better at inducing long-term protective CD8 mediated immunity than attenuated viruses. Therefore, the effect of reduced virulence on immunogenicity becomes a central issue when attempting to derive a truly effective T cell vaccine that incorporates attenuated vectors. In this application, we will investigate the molecular basis that differentiates attenuated from non-attenuated vaccines by focusing on vaccine virus (VACV). We will use several clinically relevant natural and recombinant VACV variants that differ in their ability to modulate host immune responses and test the idea that the level of virus replication, influenced by virulence and evasion tactics, can lead to differential expression and selective use of essential activating and inhibitory receptors on CD8 T cells, to allow efficient immune responses and persistence of memory. Specifically, we will test the idea that generation of protective anti-viral CD8 T cell responses in the lung are highly regulated by the tumor-necrosis-factor receptor (TNFR) family member, herpes virus-entry mediator (HVEM). Recently it was found that HVEM could act as a molecular switch between pro inflammatory and inhibitory signaling by respectively binding with its endogenous ligand (LIGHT) from the TNF family and ITIM-containing inhibitory molecule B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) from the Ig like CD28/B7 family. The crosstalk between these two different families and especially between co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptors has raised many new questions with regards to the precise mechanisms of immune modulation through these interactions. Directly relevant to this proposal, the precise contribution of HVEM interacting with its binding partners in anti-viral responses is unknown. By performing phenotypic and functional studies of epitome-specific effectors and memory CD8 T cell populations in various situations of alternate inflammation, we propose firstly to formulate a picture of the LIGHT-HVEM-BTLA interactions that may be required to generate a virus-reactive T cell population, and secondly to formulate a rationale strategy for targeting these molecules to promote long-term protective T cell memory against respiratory viral infections. Collectively, these studies will provide new insight into the development of anti-viral CD8 T cell responses and facilitate the translational research development of novel adjuvant and vaccine strategies.","2C"
2013,8414887,"5 R01 AI092573-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes latent infections that affect a third of the world's population and active tuberculosis (TB) kills two million people every year. Chemotherapy of TB requires long treatment regimens and is complicated by the emergence of multi-drug resistant and extensively drug resistant Mtb strains. New drugs that shorten TB chemotherapy and cure drug resistant TB are urgently needed and their development requires a better understanding of the mechanisms used by this pathogen to persist in the host and cause disease. Pathogens need to acquire carbon from the host to establish and maintain an infection. Metabolic pathways used by Mtb during infections are therefore important for pathogenesis and can guide the development of new chemotherapies. Mtb is highly adapted to nutritionally stringent niches in the host and mounting evidence suggests that Mtb preferentially utilizes fatty acids during infections. Our preliminary data indicate that gluconeogenesis is essential for Mtb to grow and persist in immune-competent and immune- compromised mice. We will apply transcriptomic, metabolomic and biochemical approaches to determine the molecular consequences of inhibiting gluconeogenesis in vitro and in vivo, to gain mechanistic insight into the death associated with loss of gluconeogenic enzymes in vitro and during mouse infections, to identify inhibitors of gluconeogenesis and to validate gluconeogenic enzymes as potential drug targets. The proposed work will extend the limited knowledge on Mtb's metabolism during infection and validate novel targets for chemotherapy.","6D"
2013,8414889,"5 R01 AI094602-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With over 33 million HIV-1 infections world-wide, there is no doubt that an effective HIV-1 vaccine is urgently needed. The modest and quite unexpected protection observed in the recent RV144 vaccine trial, inducing non-neutralizing antibodies, underscores the necessity of greater immunological understanding to the development of an effective vaccine. Of particular note is that the combination vaccine used in the RV144 trial elicited a robust HIV-1-specific CD4+ T cell response. Although most licensed vaccines induce high-affinity antibodies, the generation of these antibodies is critically dependent on the presence and action of CD4+ T cells. Of central importance to this process is the germinal center (GC) reaction within the lymphoid follicles, wherein the T follicular helper (TFH) cell subset plays a key role. The finely-tuned interplay of several B- and CD4+ T- cell receptors in the GC is vital for B cell maturation, proliferation, and antibody class switching. Yet at present very little is known about the role and function of TFH cells or their contribution to the control of viral infections. Moreover, little is known about the basic immunological interactions between B cells and TFH cells in humans. Recent studies demonstrated that B and TFH cells undergo a tight initial interaction, which is among other receptors mediated by the SLAM-associated protein (SAP). Mutations within SAP cause a lethal immunodeficiency, called X-linked lymphoproliferative disease. Interestingly, although early studies described an impairment of germinal center formation in progressive HIV-1 disease, it is to date unknown whether TFH cells are affected by HIV-1 infection. Moreover, it is important to consider that most HIV infections are acquired through the genital and rectal mucosa and therefore the primary sites in which a strong antiviral immune response needs to be induced. Here, local anti-HIV IgA responses that are largely absent during infection are likely to be most effective to prevent infection. The critical signals for the generation of anti-IgA antibodies are a result of TFH and B cell interactions. Thus, TFH cell responses are a key component for the generation of IgA immunity at the mucosa, and it is reasonable to believe that an understanding of the induction of these responses against HIV will be important for vaccine design. Based on our preliminary findings, we propose in specific aim #1 to assess the presence, function and differences in the phenotype of T follicular helper cells in the lymph nodes of subjects with HIV-1 infection In specific aim #2 we plan to investigate whether T follicular helper cell responses from the gastrointestinal tract are able to induce and promote anti-HIV-1 secretory IgA. In specific aim #3, we plan to investigate the properties of the CD4+ and B cell interaction, and whether this interaction in subjects enables the generation of neutralizing antibody responses. Thus, this proposal aims to study the central interaction of B cells and TFH cells in HIV-1 infection and its impact on the generation of HIV-1 protection on mucosal surfaces","4A"

The only treatment currently available is a combination therapy of pegylated interferon and Ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue. Unfortunately this combination has exhibited limited efficacy in less than half of treated patients, as well as being plagued with treatment- limiting side effects and toxicity. In addition, increasing reports of drug resistance to investigational small molecules in clinical trials are emerging, underscoring the need for new and more effective treatments. A number of modified nucleosides have exhibited potent activity as inhibitors of HCV polymerase, however problems with ineffective delivery, toxicity, instability and/or poor pharmacokinetics have rendered many promising analogues unsuitable, thus many researchers are turning to use of a prodrug, or  masking  group, on the 5'-OH of the nucleoside, to overcome these problems. This application focuses on a series of expanded purine nucleoside analogues that we anticipate will exhibit potent activity against the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NS5B due to a number of strategically designed structural features. The impact of this application is two-fold; one, the medicinal discoveries could ultimately have a global impact, as more effective HCV treatments are desperately needed. In addition, the basic scientific impacts include expanding the breadth of our knowledge of drug delivery methods for specific targeting of the HCV NS5B polymerase, as well as liver cells. In addition, new and improved methodology for nucleoside analogue synthesis will be investigated. As such, the scientific impact of this work goes beyond just global health research, but will also provide valuable training for students, as the synthetic organic and drug delivery methodologies and the information obtained about polymerases will be highly applicable across a broad scope of diseases.","6D"
2013,8415493,"5 R01 AI095453-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The staggering numbers of people afflicted with and dying from malaria are well-recognized, as is the ongoing spread of drug-resistant malaria. Although many fewer patients have African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), this infection is uniformly fatal if not treated and current therapies are toxic, expensive, and require parenteral administration. Safe and effective regimens for malaria and sleeping sickness are urgently needed. Given the limited resources available to tackle this problem it is critical to identify strategies that maximize efficacy and minimize the likelihood of resistance, and that reduce the time required to develop new agents. Pivotal in this is a clear understanding of essential pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships.  For anti-infectives in general, the efficacy of a given drug exposure (area under the concentration-time curve, AUC) is mediated either by peak concentration (CMAX) or by time over a minimum effective concentration (TMIC). This property is class-wide and not predictable. Insight into this essential PK/PD relationship can inform many aspects of a drug development program, and also lead to more rational dosing of already-marketed drugs. Remarkably, almost nothing is known about the essential PK/PDs that govern antimalarial and antitrypanosomal drug action.  The proposed work will utilize a novel in vitro perfusion system that exposes Plasmodium falciparum or Trypanosoma brucei to constantly changing drug concentrations, mimicking those encountered in humans after drug dosing. The apparatus can be programmed to deliver a given AUC in any desired PK profile, including extremes of CMAX or TMIC. Pilot studies demonstrate that rigorous proof-of-concept PK/PD studies are now possible. In Aim 1 this new system will be used to describe the essential PK/PDs for selected antimalarials, to determine whether these relationships are class-wide, if they correlate with those for bacteria, and how the PK/PD relationship is affected by, and itself affects, drug resistance. Aim 2 will focus on the essential PK/PDs of antitrypanosomal drugs. Though the concept of CMAX- or TMIC-mediated efficacy is new to antiprotozoals, and the experimental method is innovative, the deliverables of this project are near-guaranteed. Results of this work will include a robust well-characterized method for determining the essential PK/PD relationships; first-ever descriptions of the PK/PD requirements for most classes of clinically useful antimalarial and antitrypanosomal drugs and a few experimental agents; and preliminary insights into the possible role of PKs in antimalarial drug resistance. Perhaps most important, it will provide a heretofore missing framework within which antimalarial and antitrypanosomal agents can be judged and used rationally.","6D"
2013,8415500,"5 R21 AI097809-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects more than 170 million people worldwide, causing acute and chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)[1]. Notably, increases in HCV cirrhosis have played a major role in the recent rise in HCC, accounting for up to 50% of cases in the United States[2]. With no vaccine available to protect against HCV infection and only a subset of chronically infected patients responding to current treatment options[3], there is an obvious and immediate need for new effective HCV antivirals as well as the HCV experimental model systems that would support advancement in this area. In particular, HCV entry represents a promising multi-faceted opportunity for drug discovery (reviewed in[4]), but a deeper understanding and coherent description of the process is needed to facilitate such endeavors. Thus, our long term goal is to understand the cellular and viral factors that mediate HCV entry in order to identify novel molecular targets amendable to therapeutic intervention and enable the development of transgenic mouse models permissive for HCV entry. Relevant to this long term goal, we recently discovered that the cellular cholesterol uptake receptor Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) is required for HCV entry. Based on the observation that exogenous expression of NPC1L1 on the surface of CHO cells results in binding of the cholesterol-enriched HCV virion and the fact that NPC1L1 exhibits restricted tissue distribution and is expressed on human but not mouse hepatocytes, we hypothesize that NPC1L1 is a cholesterol-dependent HCV entry receptor responsible for the restricted human-hepatocyte tropism of HCV entry. As such, we propose to 1) Characterize the interaction between HCV and NPC1L1 during HCV entry by identifying the determinants of the interaction and assessing how and when NPC1L1 functions during the viral entry process; and 2) Elucidate the role of NPC1L1 in HCV tropism by determining if NPC1L1 expression confers HCV permissiveness to non-hepatic and non-human cells. Importantly, these studies will lay the groundwork that will enable a more detailed and specifically focused studies aimed at thoroughly understanding how NPC1L1 participates in HCV entry so that such interactions can be potentially exploited for therapeutic intervention and the development of a mouse model that supports HCV entry.","2D"

One of the major contributing factors to chronic levels of unmet need for treatment among this population is the unavailability and inaccessibility of treatment services. Service accessibilty is particularly limited in rural areas. To address problems of service availability and accessibiliy in rural areas, the use of video teleconferencing technology to provide direct services has emerged within the fields of medicine and psychiatry in particular. The use of such technology to enhance the delivery of behavioral psychotherapy is beginning to emerge as well. A handful of primarily small-scale pilot and feasibility studies indicate that psychotherapy interventions administered using video teleconferencing technology may be as effective as traditional face-to-face interventions. Few randomized clinical trials of telepsychotherapy have been conducted to date, however, and virtually none have examined video teleconferencing interventions for any type of child or adolescent behavioral problem including substance abuse. The proposed study is intended to address the need for research evaluating the application of video teleconferencing technology as a means of service delivery for substance abusing adolescents and their families living in rural areas. Specifically, the current proposal is a randomized clinical trial testing th efficacy of Functional Family Therapy (FFT) administered by video teleconference (FFT-V) in the homes of substance abusing adolescents. In the proposed investigation, FFT-V will be compared with FFT administered face-to- face in the family home as well as to a services-as-usual (SAU) condition. The overarching objective of the study is to examine the degree to which an empirically based model of substance abuse treatment such as FFT can be effectively administered via video teleconferencing to adolescents and families living in rural and remote areas who would be otherwise unlikely to access treatment. The specific aims of the proposed study are to (1) evaluate the efficacy of FFT-V compared to FFT and SAU in reducing adolescent drug use, HIV risk behavior, delinquency, and recidivism, (2) evaluate the efficacy of FFT-V compared to FFT in establishing functional levels of therapeutic alliance formation, treatment attendance, retention, and satisfaction with treatment, (3) evaluate the efficacy of FFT-V compared to FFT and SAU in impacting core mechanisms of change in adolescent behavior including improved levels of family functioning and adolescent association with substance using peers, and (4) conduct a preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis to derive initial estimates of the relative costs of each treatment modality per outcome unit. .","5A"

This complex of accessory proteins can be considered a molecular machine whose job it is to (i) pump the peptide products of protein degradation into the region of MHC class I assembly (ii) recruit unassembled MHC class I (iii) facilitate MHC class I-peptide assembly and (iv) ensure regulated release of optimally loaded MHC class I. Much remains to be understood about the workings of this intricate molecular machine, which has been the focus of our research for the past eleven years. Based on our previous work with the TAP transporter, we are able to propose a detailed model for how ATP binding and hydrolysis couple to peptide binding and transport. In the proposed studies we will examine effects of TAP substrates on nucleotide binding and exchange by TAP, and on interactions between the nucleotide binding domains (NBD). A model for the peptide-binding site of TAP will also be examined. These investigations will allow for better understanding of how TAP can be manipulated to enhance or suppress immune responses, and will also allow for better predictions of immunodominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes. Based on analyses of the assembly characteristics of various MHC class I allotypes in tapasin-deficient cells, it is our hypothesis that tapasin is essential for peptide loading of MHC class I allotypes that have slow intrinsic peptide loading kinetics. Peptide binding properties of tapasin dependent and independent MHC class I allotypes will be compared under different conditions. Our data suggest that tapasin is responsible for recruiting calreticulin and ERp57 into the peptide loading complex. Furthermore different conformational states of tapasin-ERp57 complexes had different activities in enhancing peptide loading of MHC class I molecules. We seek to better understand the nature of the differences. We also seek to understand the role of careticulin in tapasin-assisted MHC class I assembly. Although all MHC class I molecules appear to follow the same assembly route within the ER, closely related HLA-B allotypes differ dramatically in their intrinsic rates of assembly and ER exit. In the studies proposed here, we seek to classify high frequency HLA-B alleles as rapid or slow trafficking, and to also examine the functional consequences of rapid or slow trafficking upon antigen presentation and disease progression. It is our hypothesis that the trafficking phenotypes can impact both the CTL response and the NK cell response, which will be further examined. Together, these studies will allow for a better understanding of the different steps of the MHC class I assembly route, and will contribute to the development of more effective strategies to enhance CTL responses in infection and cancer.","2C"
2013,8415537,"5 R01 AI081600-05","Treatment with appropriate combinations of antiretroviral drugs can reduce HIV-1 viremia to below the limit of detection and allow reconstitution of the immune system. The correct choice of antiretroviral drugs is critical for achieving and maintaining suppression of viral replication. Interestingly, there is no widely accepted system for comparing the antiviral activity of different drugs. Previous studies from this lab have shown that the inhibitory potential of antiretroviral drugs is strongly dependent upon a previously ignored factor termed here the slope parameter. This parameter describes the steepness of the dose-response curve. The inhibitory potential of antiretroviral drugs, described in a new index developed by this lab, varies for different classes of antiretroviral drugs by over 10 logs (10,000,000,000 fold!) in a manner that is strongly influence by the slope parameter. Thus the slope parameter is a critical missing dimension in the analysis of the suppressive potential of antiretroviral drugs. This proposal seeks to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect and to use that information to guide the development of drugs and vaccines that will maximally suppress viral replication. The first specific aim is to test a mechanistic hypothesis involving a unique form of intermolecular cooperativity which can explain the shapes of dose-response curves for antiviral drugs. This hypothesis will be tested in a very specific way using phenotypic mixing experiments with viruses carrying both wild type and mutant forms of the proteins targeted by the drugs. The second aim is to understand the high magnitude and drug-to-drug variability of the slope parameter for the protease inhibitor class of antiretroviral drugs. Among the drug classes tested to date, the protease inhibitors show the highest slope values. As a result, clinical concentrations of some of these drugs can inhibit single round infections by ~10 logs. This project seeks to identify the mechanism underlying this extraordinary susceptibility of HIV-1 to inhibition by some protease inhibitors. The third specific aim is to apply this method of analysis to novel classes of antiretroviral drugs. Since a high slope value is critical for achieving multi-log inhibition of single round infection, the proposed analyses could identify drug classes that are likely to be particularly effective in vivo. The fourth aim is to determine the effect of drug resistance mutations on dose-response curve slope. Correct prediction of the clinical consequences of drug resistance mutations requires an understanding of the effects of the mutations on the slope parameter. The final aim is to measure the slope parameter of neutralizing antibodies directed at the HIV-1 envelope protein since concept of dose-response curve slope also applies to vaccine-induced effector mechanisms including neutralizing antibodies.","6A"

Celentano, Principal Investigator. This CTU focuses on recruiting injecting drug users (IDU) and high risk Asian populations affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, into phase IIb and III clinical trials investigating novel strategies to prevent HIV infection. We will address two of the high priority clinical research areas identified by DAIDS in its RFA-AI-05-002: Prevention of HIV Infection and Microbicides. For prevention of HIV infection we will affiliate with the proposed HIV Prevention Trials Network. The JHU Southern Asia CTU consists of an administrative component at Johns Hopkins and clinical research sites (CRS) in northern Thailand and southern India. In northern Thailand we are proposing a cluster of research sites led by the Research Institute for Health Sciences (RIHES) at Chiang Mai University (CMU) (Thira Sirisanthana, site leader). In southern India we propose a research site at the YR Gaitonde Center for Substance Abuse-related Research (YRG CSAR), Chennai (Suniti Solomon, site leader). We have longstanding research collaborations with both these units, and have been collaborators on past HPTN studies. Three HPTN studies are under way at the Chiang Mai site and will continue into the period this RFA. HPTN 037, a Phase III behavioral study of the efficacy of a social network intervention in preventing HIV infection among IDUs, began in Chiang Mai in March 2004; the site has a recruitment target of 1,740 volunteers; we propose expanding enrollment to the Chennai site. HPTN 043, a Phase III study of the effectiveness of community based voluntary counseling and testing to prevent HIV infection at a community level, is being carried out in 14 communities in northern Thailand. This study is largely supported by NIMH but was developed by the HPTN; the baseline survey began in January 2005, with interventions beginning in September 2005. HPTN 052, a Phase III IND clinical trial, of the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy in reducing sexual transmission of HIV among discordant couples, began in Chiang Mai in June 2005 with a site enrollment target of 243 couples. A fourth HPTN protocol under development, HPTN 058, is expected to begin in Chiang Mai, and expand to Chennai, in the next year. This is a Phase III IND clinical trial of the efficacy of opioid substitution therapy with buprenorphine/naloxone for prevention of HIV infection.","5A,5B"
2013,8415554,"5 K23 AI089271-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Adolescent and young women are at high risk for HIV and STI acquisition. Developing novel, safe, preventative options for this population, such as vaginal microbicides, requires a thorough understanding of mucosal immunity in the female genital tract. Prior studies have evaluated the genital mucosal immune environment in adult women and indicate that protective factors in cervicovaginal fluid exhibit intrinsic activity against HIV, herpes simplex virus, and multiple types of pathogenic bacteria. However these data are lacking in young, adolescent women, and it remains unknown how innate immunity in the genital tract develops during adolescence. Moreover little is known of the functional components of genital mucosal immunity in young women infected with HIV, who may use microbicides with no knowledge of their infection or who may wish to use a microbicide to prevent infection with another STI or to prevent HIV transmission to their partner. This application addresses these knowledge gaps through the following specific aims: [(1) evaluate the differences in genital mucosal immunity in HIV uninfected females ages 13-21 years who are either within three years of menarche or greater than three years from menarche by comparing endogenous antimicrobial activity in genital secretions between the two groups and correlating this activity with specific immune mediators and vaginal microbiota populations; (2) evaluate the differences in genital mucosal immunity between a cohort of HIV infected young women ages 13-21 years and a cohort of healthy, uninfected women of similar age distribution by comparing endogenous antimicrobial activity in genital secretions and correlating this activity with specific immune mediators and vaginal microbiota populations.] The results of these studies will have significant implications for future studies of HIV and STI prevention and acquisition in young women. My objective is to become an independent investigator with expertise in STI acquisition and prevention in adolescent women. I have proposed a career development plan that incorporates mentorship in translational research methods, specialized training in novel laboratory techniques, individualized coursework, and participation in local and national meetings.","2A"
2013,8415557,"5 R01 AI087390-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Early steps in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) replication involve delivery of the viral core into the cytoplasm of the host cell. When the viral core has reached the cytoplasm a process known as  uncoating  takes place. Uncoating is the process by which monomeric capsid sheds from the retroviral core. Simultaneously, the viral RNA genome is converted into viral DNA (vDNA), which is subsequently translocated to the nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA, allowing expression and production of new viral particles. Although the relationship between capsid shedding and synthesis of viral DNA (vDNA) is not understood, the stability of the viral core in the cytoplasm seems to be important for productive infection. Changes in stability of the retroviral core seem to affect vDNA synthesis: 1) mutations in the capsid protein of HIV-1 that diminish (or increase) the stability of the HIV-1 core interfere with vDNA synthesis; 2) TRIM51 proteins block HIV-1 replication by altering the stability of the retroviral core and disrupt vDNA synthesis; 3) HIV-1 cores isolated from particles produced in the absence of accessory proteins such as vif, vpr or nef exhibit low stability and are poorly infectious due to a defect in vDNA synthesis; 4) the use of proteasome inhibitors during HIV-1 infection increases the stability of the core, and at the same time augments the synthesis of vDNA; 5) Isolated HIV-1 cores require cellular extracts in order to undergo vDNA synthesis, indicating the requirement of host factors; and 6) isolated retroviral cores last longer in cytosolic extracts than in isotonic buffer, suggesting the existence of core-stabilizing factors that are essential for vDNA synthesis. Altogether, this evidence indicates that viral core stability and successful vDNA synthesis involve a delicate balance of tightly interwoven events. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that optimal stability of the retroviral core and cellular factors modulate the rate and extent of uncoating in the cytoplasm, and that this rate and extent of uncoating is required for the occurrence of complete viral DNA synthesis. We will test this hypothesis by performing the following experiments: 1) we will study the effect of factors that destabilize the retroviral core on viral DNA synthesis, 2) we will study the contribution of the proteasome to retroviral uncoating, and 3) we will study the modulation of vDNA synthesis by the interaction of reverse transcriptase with the retroviral ribonucleoprotein complex. The results from these experiments will generate basic knowledge in the uncoating of HIV-1. Uncoating is a poorly explored step on HIV-1 therapeutics; however, we have learned from restriction factors, such as TRIM5, that uncoating is potentially a very effective target for HIV-1 therapeutics.","2B"
2013,8415561,"5 R37 AI064003-08","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ancestors of modern organisms were colonized by viruses that were very rarely beneficial, and often deleterious to the host. Inevitably, hosts adapted to limit viral replication, and in so doing evolved various autonomous antiviral defense mechanisms. One of these is TRIM5, which is multimeric protein that recognizes incoming retroviral capsids, but its precise mechanisms of action are unclear. In specific aim 1 we will develop new techniques to understand what happens to various incoming components of retroviral particles as they complete the early steps of their life cycle. These assays will very likely illuminate the mechanisms by which TRIM5 proteins and other antiretroviral factors exert their inhibitory effects. Moreover, these techniques are likely to have a wide range of applications in the study of these steps of the retroviral life cycle. In specific aim 2 we will derive TRIM5-resistant HIV-1 capsids that will identify residues on the surface of the HIV-1 capsid that are targeted by TRIM5 and will serve a useful tools to probe the mechanism of action of TRIM5. Additionally these capsids will be used for generating simian-tropic HIV- strains that can replicate in rhesus macaques. In addition to known antiretroviral proteins like TRIM5, there are several reasons to think that there are more, perhaps many more, antiviral host defense genes in to be discovered. In specific aim 3, we will attempt to identify such genes by constructing focused, arrayed cDNA libraries, each consisting of tens to hundreds of candidate genes, that either (i) have key properties exhibited by known antiretroviral genes or (ii) are selectively expressed in cells that exhibit constitutive or induced resistance to HIV-1 or SIV infection. These genes libraries will be arrayed each gene will be individually tested for its ability to inhibit retrovirus replication.","2B"

CIRCA will conduct these studies at five clinical research sites (CRS) located in New York City (NYC) and Newark, New Jersey-two of the communities most severely affected by the HIV epidemic in the US. CIRCA will focus on conducting studies with populations that are at the highest risk for HIV infection in the U.S. and that have traditionally been underrepresented in clinical trials including African Americans, Hispanics, women and substance users. CIRCA is a consortium administratively situated at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University with five CRSs. The Harlem HIV Prevention Center and the University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) site will participate in both HPTN and MTN studies, the two New York Blood Center sites will participate in HPTN studies and the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center site will participate in MTN studies. Tie four CRSs in NYC have worked together for the past five years successfully conducting HPTN sponsored prevention and Microbicide studies. They are partnering in this application with the UMDNJ site, a site with extensive experience in prevention and with a commitment to the same populations at risk for HIV. The CIRC^ investigators bring a wealth of expertise that spans the disciplines required to advance the scientific agendas of the HPTN and MTN. They have led and participated in multi-center research, have been key participants in scientific working groups and protocol teams, have practical field experience, have developed innovative behavioral and biomedical interventions and have utilized creative methods to evaluate the impact of the interventions. Most importantly, the investigators have gained the trust of their communities. They have established the framework for the ethical conduct of research in disenfranchised communities. They have formed a vigorous and vibrant community advisory board to ensure community education and involvement. CIRCA is a cohesive unit with an efficient organizational plan, effective recruitment and retention plans, a rigorous quality assurance system and a meticulous process for data collection and management. Unfortunately, the magnitude of the HIV epidemic in the US is underestimated. More than 40,000 new HIV infections occur every year, primarily in those very communities where CIRCA sites are situated. The complementary skills and experiences of the CIRCA staff and investigators as well as their shared commitment to their communities will enable them to contribute to the discovery of new strategies to prevent the further spread of HIV in the US and around the world.

The WHRG consists of five Clinical Research Sites (CRSs) supported by a coordinating centre. This group has the capacity to undertake research in 5 high priority areas of HIV clinical trial research. The priority areas include Optimization of Clinical Management of HIV; Drug Development and Translational Research; HIV Prevention; Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV; HIV Vaccine Research and Development; and Microbicide Development. The CTU will link with five leadership networks (ACTG, IMPAACT, Microbicide Network, HVTN and PTN), maximizing scientific and recruitment opportunities by effectively integrating prevention, vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials in children, adolescents and adults. The unit will build on an established track record of the University of the Witwatersrand ACTU (Site#11101), PACTG (Site#8051), HPTN (Site#001-7) and a track record of international collaboration for microbicide research. In addition to our excellent record of research, this CTU contains four sites with letters confirming their status as selected sites for collaboration on four networks. The WHRG has a talented and skilled group of senior investigators with international reputations supported by enthusiastic research teams who are committed to HIV prevention in resource poor settings and the identification and management of acute HIV infections. The research team of the CTU has demonstrated an ability to work collaboratively with each other in all facets of the five networks and on PEPFAR initiatives. It is our aim to create a synergistic, pluri-potential CTU that is able to implement world-class research. In so doing, we also aim to achieve financial and operational efficiencies through centralizing and consolidating critical clinical research functions such as staff training, protocol implementation, regulatory compliance, IRB submission, pharmacy importation and data and quality management. The WHRG has close collaboration and support from the local, provincial and national Departments of Health, as well as from its own institutions.

It is known that a host of macrophage inflammatory and viral products engage NMDARs, but there is very limited information available on how these receptors can be  best  utilized for optimal therapeutic benefit. To this end we seek funds to assess the role of HIV-1-infected and immune competent mononuclear phagocytes (MPs, brain perivascular macrophages and microglia) to affect extrasynaptic NR2BRs. MPs are the natural virus target cells and the key to neuronal dysfunction in HIV-1- associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Immunocytochemical, pharmacological and electrophysiological techniques will examine the role of extrasynaptic NR2BRs in HIV-1 infected MP-induced neuronal dysfunction and resultant cognitive impairment in laboratory and animal models of human disease. First, we will examine direct activation of NR2BRs by HIV-1 infected MP and resultant neurotoxic activity. Second, we will investigate the role of NR2BRs in HIV-1 infected MP-induced alteration of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Third, we will study whether HIV-1 infected MP-induced, NR2BR-mediated alteration of cellular and synaptic physiology contributes to HAND, and to explore potential protective effects of NR2BR antagonists in a relevant murine model of HIV disease. Overall, these studies are focused toward not only understanding the role that the subtype and location of NMDARs might play in HAND, but also on developing more realistic means to harness these pathways for therapeutic benefit. If successful, these studies will provide a proper roadmap for expected efficacy of NMDAR antagonists in ameliorating brain injury.","2G"
2013,8415829,"5 R01 AI070101-07","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus (HCV) establishes chronic infection in the liver of nearly 80% of those infected and in addition to causing hepatitis, may cause liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. These detrimental long-term sequelae of persistent HCV infection now comprise the leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States. Defining the elements of the immune response that fail or are insufficient to mediate HCV clearance or resolution in the majority of those infected is critical for advancing our understanding of how to therapeutically intervene in HCV disease pathogenesis. It is known in murine models that a subset of liver dendritic cells, pDCs, express the co-inhibitory molecule B7-H1 to mediate PD-1 dependent T cell dysfunction and that another subset, the mDCs, are capable of inhibiting T cell proliferation and inducing T cell apoptosis. Therefore we hypothesized that defects in DC function might contribute to the establishment of chronic HCV infection. In looking at DC populations in HCV-infected liver we observed: (i) a marked absence of a novel population of myeloid DC progenitors, (ii) an influx of mature DCs compared to uninfected liver and (iii) an activated DC population expressing high levels of T cell co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules. Based on these data we now hypothesize that the chronic HCV liver microenvironment promotes the differentiation of myeloid liver DCs, and that these DCs skew HCV-specific T cell responses toward the induction of tolerance through B7-mediated inhibition and aberrant cytokine secretion. We now propose to study the effects of HCV infection on liver DC recruitment and activation and to test the capacity of liver DC subsets from chronically infected patients to process and present HCV-derived antigens to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These studies will identify potential defects in the functional DC response to HCV-infection, and will reveal potential targets for therapeutic intervention.","2D"
2013,8415838,"5 R01 AI098485-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tetherin (BST-2 or CD317) is an interferon-inducible transmembrane protein that inhibits virus release from infected cells. Whereas most simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) use Nef to overcome restriction by tetherin in their non-human primate hosts, HIV-1 Vpu and HIV-2 Env have evolved to serve this function in humans due to the absence of sequences in the cytoplasmic domain of human tetherin that confer susceptibility to Nef. We recently identified compensatory changes in the cytoplasmic tail of gp41 that restore resistance to tetherin in a nef-deleted strain of SIV that regained a pathogenic phenotype in rhesus macaques. These observations are analogous to the adaptation of HIV-2 Env for antagonism of human tetherin and imply that resistance to tetherin is important for lentiviral pathogenesis. We have now identified HIV-1 Nef alleles that are able to counteract restriction by human tetherin, underscoring the extraordinary plasticity of the primate lentiviruses in adapting to the tetherin proteins of their hosts and revealing a previously unappreciated role for Nef in HIV-1 infection. The studies outlined in this proposal build on this work to reveal the fundamental mechanisms of lentiviral resistance to tetherin and their role in immunodeficiency virus infection. Our first objective (Aim 1) is to define the molecular interactions and cellular trafficking pathways involved in tetherin antagonism by Nef, and the fate of tetherin (degradation versus sequestration) in SIV-infected cells. These studies will build on work by our group identifying Nef as the viral gene product of SIV that counteracts restriction by tetherin and will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of lentiviral resistance to tetherin. Our second objective (Aim 2) is define the genetic changes associated with the gain of anti-tetherin activity by HIV-1 Nef and the mechanism by which HIV-1 Nef counteracts human tetherin. These studies are important for determining how widespread anti-tetherin activity is for Nef alleles of primary HIV-1 isolates, the circumstances that lead to the gain of this function by HIV-1 Nef, and the mechanistic differences in tetherin antagonism by HIV-1 Nef versus SIV Nef. Our third objective (Aim 3) is to assess the natural variation in anti- tetherin activity for primary HIV-2 Ev proteins and to define the sequences in Env required for this activity. These studies will reveal the prevalence/range of anti-tetherin activity for primary HIV-2 Env proteins and the molecular adaptations in Env that contribute to this activity. By comparing the activity of Env alleles derived from individuals with progressive courses of HIV-2 infection to Env alleles derived from asymptomatic individuals who contain virus replication, these studies will reveal whether differences in tetherin antagonism are related to differences in HIV-2 pathogenesis.","2B"
2013,8415848,"5 R01 DA033067-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prevention strategies that aim to test and treat people for HIV infection are undermined by HIV treatment non-adherence and sexually transmitted co-infections (STI). Scalable interventions are urgently needed to sustain low infectiousness by improving HIV treatment adherence and reducing risks for transmitting HIV. This application proposes to test a theory-based behavioral intervention to simultaneously improve HIV treatment adherence and reduce HIV transmission risk behaviors in people living with HIV/AIDS who use alcohol and other drugs. Grounded in Conflict Theory of Decision Making, the intervention will be delivered in a mixed format, with one office-based counseling session followed by four cell phone delivered counseling sessions. The intervention will be conducted in Atlanta and surrounding impoverished areas. Men (n = 250) and women (n = 250) receiving HIV treatment will be recruited from AIDS services and infectious disease clinics. Following informed consent and baseline assessments, participants will be randomly assigned to either an (a) integrated HIV treatment adherence - risk reduction intervention or (b) a time-matched non-contaminating attention control condition. Participants will be followed for 12-months using office-based computerized interviews, unannounced pill counts, and medical chart abstraction. The study will test the hypothesis that a unified, integrated theory-based HIV treatment and risk reduction intervention will reduce HIV transmission risk behaviors, improve HIV treatment adherence, reduce viral load and prevent new STI. The study will also examine the influence of theoretical constructs and structural barriers on intervention outcomes. Factors that predict relapse to non-adherence and risk behaviors in relation to changes in viral load and STI over the 12-month follow-up period will also be a focal point of the study. The intervention under investigation will be among the first to simultaneously address treatment adherence and risk behavior in an integrated model for substance using HIV positive men and women. If shown effective, the intervention model will be ready for immediate dissemination to community and clinical services for people living with HIV/AIDS.","5A"
2013,8415849,"5 R01 DA031285-02","Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) is one of the strongest and most consistent predictors of adolescent problems. Youth who have experienced CSA are at significant risk for early initiation, use, and abuse of substances. For example. research has indicated that adolescent CSA victims are over 3.5 times more likely to report marijuana abuse/dependence compared to non-CSA victims. Other negative sequelae, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and HIV sexual risk behaviors, also have been clearly linked with CSA. Remarkably, no behavioral interventions have been developed and rigorously evaluated for this population that: a) take an integrated approach to targeting such sequelae through use of existing empirically supported interventions; and b) incorporate risk reduction for less symptomatic youth. Risk reduction and treatment tailored to adolescent CSA victims, which addresses the individual, family, and community risk and resiliency factors for adolescent substance use problems and incorporates exposure-based treatment for PTSD symptoms, as well as evidence based prevention interventions for HIV-related sexual behaviors, and is warranted. Risk Reduction through Family Therapy (RRFT) has been developed by the PI, a NIDA-K awardee (K23DA018686) and Early Stage Investigator, for this purpose. Preliminary findings from a Stage 1a feasibility trial and a Stage 1b pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) are promising, indicating that RRFT can be readily learned and implemented with fidelity, and that it can lead to improvements in drug use and drug use-related risk and protective factors, PTSD symptoms, and HIV sexual risk behaviors (Danielson et al., 2010). In following NIDA's recommended stage model of behavioral therapy development, the overall goal of this application is to conduct a Stage II RCT to more rigorously evaluate the efficacy of RRFT (vs. Treatment As Usual) from pre-treatment through 18 months. The first specific aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of RRFT in reducing substance use problems and prognostic factors among CSA victims experiencing trauma-related symptoms. The second specific aim is to evaluate the efficacy of RRFT in reducing PTSD and HIV sexual risk behaviors among this population. In order to better make maximum use of the data from this proposed efficacy trial and to inform potential next steps in this line of treatment research (per NOT-DA-019), preliminary investigation on mechanisms of action in RRFT also will be pursued as an exploratory aim. Specifically, intermediate targets of RRFT, such as parenting practices and emotional reactivity, as putative mechanisms of action for improvements in substance use and PTSD and risky sexual behaviors will be explored. The results of the proposed study will have a significant impact on public health by informing intervention efforts for the multifaceted clinical needs of adolescent CSA victims, who are at high risk for drug use, HIV infection, other problems in adolescence and adulthood. Demonstrating the efficacy of this promising risk reduction and treatment approach could provide a valuable clinical tool for community-based therapists.","5A"
2013,8415857,"5 R21 AI094074-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis is still killing millions of people worldwide annually and the emergence of drug-resistant strains rekindles the global concern on public health threatened by TB. The growing prevalence of drug-resistant TB highlights the need for an effective vaccine. BCG, the only licensed TB vaccine, does not reliably protect adults from pulmonary TB. Numerous experimental TB vaccine candidates are not fundamentally superior to BCG in terms of vaccine efficacy in animal models. Conventional approaches to vaccine development, including antigen and adjuvant discovery, may not produce a breakthrough TB vaccine; new paradigms of vaccination are needed. The immune system has regulatory mechanisms to curtail excessive activation and limit tissue damage caused by infections and autoimmunity. Regulatory factors produced by dendritic cells (DC) include cytokines (e.g. IL-10), DC ligands for T cell inhibitory receptors (e.g. PDL1 and PDL2), and intracellular signaling regulators (e.g. SOCS1, SOCS2, and IRAK-M). These act to limit DC-mediated activation of effector T cells and to promote the differentiation of regulatory T cells. Vaccine adjuvants are needed to activate DC for T cell priming, but these adjuvants simultaneously induce the expression of suppressive genes. We hypothesize that the maximum immunostimulatory potential of vaccines is limited by counter-regulatory signals stimulated by the adjuvant. To test that hypothesis we propose the innovative concept of using siRNA to shape the immune response to vaccination. To apply siRNA as a vaccine component, efficient in vivo siRNA delivery is essential. We have developed a novel method for in vivo gene silencing using Glucan encapsulated siRNA Particles (GeRP). The versatility of GeRPs is such that other charged molecules, including protein antigens and adjuvant compounds can be co-packaged with siRNA inside the glucan shells using layer-by-layer synthesis. The resulting particles allow co-delivery of a complete vaccine formula to a DC via the receptor Dectin-1. The first step for proof of concept is to show that silencing one or more candidate suppressive genes (SOCS1, SOCS2, IRAK-M, IL-10, PDL1, and PDL2) by GeRP enhances T cell responses to a vaccine. Experimental approaches include DCs transfected with targeted siRNA or control siRNA and then tested for their ability to activate ovalbumin (OVA)-specific OT-II transgenic T cells in vitro and to sensitize animals with a Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen (Ag85A) in vivo. The next step will be the incorporation of the best performing siRNA sequences into GeRPs engineered to combine Ag85A, adjuvants, and siRNA in one particle that will ensure each DC sees all components. GeRP vaccine constructs will be tested for their capability to confer a protective immunity in mice against aerosol M. tuberculosis challenge. The efficacy of this novel vaccine will be evaluated for TB prophylaxis, as a post-BCG booster, and as a therapeutic vaccine in combination with antimicrobial therapy. We seek R21 support for the exploratory phase of this TB vaccine project to produce data to support an RO1 proposal with the ultimate goal of developing a GeRP TB vaccine suitable for human clinical trials. In addition to its immediate translational goal, our approach may be applicable more broadly to vaccines against other human pathogens and GeRP vaccination may be validated as a platform to probe pathways of T cell priming and immune regulation using RNAi.","6D"
2013,8415863,"5 R21 AI096999-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) is the etiological agent of AIDS. HIV infection is spread through the virus's ability to package its genome into a ~120 nm protein capsid, surround it with a lipid bilayer, and transmit infectious particles to neighboring cells, tissues and other persons. HIV assembly is driven by Gag polyprotein precursor that alone can assemble and release virus-like particles carrying a dimeric RNA genome. Critical progress in the field has provided us with structural snapshots of individual domains of HIV Gag, structural models of the RNA genome and its packaging signal, the structure of the hexameric capsid lattice, as well as images of intact immature and mature HIV virions. Live cell imaging using fluorescently tagged Gag has allowed direct visualization of HIV assembly in living cells. Yet despite this progress, we face an intellectual gap between available structural snapshots of individual conformations, and the dynamic nature of the assembly process. Here we propose to establish fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging to monitor the conformational changes of the capsid and the genome during HIV assembly. Towards this end, we have already established the technology needed to site-specifically label recombinant Gag and genomic RNA molecules with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores, which will permit smFRET imaging. Fluorescently labeled Gag and genomic RNA molecules, in the presence of excess unlabeled material, assemble into HIV particles of the correct size in an in vitro assembly reaction that depends on the additional presence of phosphoinositols. With these tools in hand, we will monitor the conformation of a single Gag molecule during the assembly into a viral particle. We have similarly labeled the HIV packaging signal to monitor the conformational dynamics of HIV RNA genomes as they are packaged as dimers into growing HIV particles. A detailed knowledge of the energy landscape and the kinetics of HIV assembly will aid in the identification of novel structural intermediates. This new information will be relevant for the rational design of antiviral therapies.","2B"
2013,8415869,"5 R01 AI089334-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Today, the majority of new HIV-1 infections result from heterosexual transmission with HIV-1 CCR5-using, R5 strains. However, there is a tight bottleneck during transmission so that only a single virus variant is transmitted in about 80% of infections. It is not known whether the transmitted viruses carry an advantage over strains that fail to transmit. However, R5 envelopes vary extensively in different properties that are likely to have a strong impact on HIV-1 transmission. These properties include (1) macrophage-tropism, (2) capacity to infect cells via low levels of CCR5 and (3) decreased sensitivity to CCR5 ligands including chemokines. Our hypothesis is that HIV-1 transmission is conferred by envelopes with distinct properties that confer an advantage for transmission. We propose the following aims. Aim 1: To investigate whether transmitted founder/acute envelopes form a distinct subset with particular properties: We will investigate HIV-1 R5 clade B and C envs for the three properties described above. We will include envs from the acute stage of infection including founder envelopes that closely represent transmitted strains. We will compare with R5 envelopes from later disease stages that cover the wide variation in the properties to be investigated. Aim 1 experiments will thus reveal whether transmitted founder/acute envelopes form a distinct subset with a particular set of properties. Aim 2: To evaluate whether founder/acute or other R5 envelopes with specific properties confer an enhanced tropism for Langerhan's cells or ectocervical explant cultures as a model for male-to-female transmission: We will investigate the R5 founder/acute envelopes as well as later disease stage envelopes that cover the variation documented in aim 1. These envelopes will be tested for infection of different DC (including LCs) and ectocervical explant cultures and investigated for trans-infection of T-cells via DCs.  Together, these experiments will help elucidate how different env properties impact on transmission. Aim 3: To identify the envelope determinants that confer efficient infection of ectocervical explant cultures: We will map envelope determinants that confer efficient infection of ectocervical explant cultures.  Our proposal will provide the first comprehensive study of how variation in the properties of R5 envs of different clades impacts on their capacity to infect different DC subsets and ectocervical explant cultures as a model for male-to-female transmission. Importantly, we will identify env properties and determinants that confer efficient transmission. The data obtained will provide new insights into the mechanisms of transmission and help identify vulnerabilities in transmitter envelopes that can be targeted by microbicides and vaccines.","2A"

2013,8415884,"5 R01 DA030257-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is growing recognition of the substantial burden of HIV infection and the potential for HIV transmission among individuals under the supervision of the criminal justice system. This is, in part, attributable to the high number of drug users under supervision and the close linkages between injection and non-injection drug use and HIV risk behaviors and infection. While there have been a growing number of interventions developed and tested to reduce HIV risk among individuals while they are incarcerated and when they return to the community, few HIV prevention interventions have been tested among the growing numbers of individuals who are diverted to community based supervision and treatment. The proposed study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a brief, personalized and automated HIV prevention intervention delivered to substance abusing offenders in the City of Philadelphia's drug treatment court program. Despite their well established efficacy in reducing recidivism and drug use (Festinger et al, 2002, Marlowe, Festinger, Dugosh et al., 2007), drug courts have yet to be evaluated in their ability to reduce HIV risk. Given the prevalence of high risk behaviors (e.g., Belenko at al., 2004) and the alarming rates of HIV infection and STIs among criminal offenders (14%-26%: Hammet et al, 2002; Spaulding et al., 2009), drug courts represent an important yet unexplored opportunity to deliver risk reduction interventions. As a centralized component of drug court, case management units typically help clients access adjunctive services and provide consultation on a number of important social and health related issues such as employment, housing, and routine medical care. Although HIV/AIDS risk reduction fits within the domain of services provided by drug court case managers, the addition of more intensive services is constrained by limited staff and resources. Fortunately, there is support for the efficacy of computerized brief interventions for reducing HIV risk (see Noar et al., 2009). We will randomly assign 400 felony drug court participants to receive either a brief computerized HIV intervention or an attention control procedure following their first three case management sessions. We will compare the groups on a number of outcomes including engagement in high risk behaviors, rates of HIV testing, and condom procurement (in addition to condom use measured as a risk behavior). We will also examine the effect of the intervention on drug court related outcomes including case management attendance, graduation rates, and urinalysis confirmed drug use. This study will be the first to examine the efficacy of using a brief, computerized HIV risk reduction intervention in drug courts. Findings will provide useful information on the utility of a practical strategy for reducing HIV risk in the growing population of substance using offenders in our communities. Findings will also have major implications for expanding the focus of drug courts and other community based correction programs beyond reducing criminal recidivism and drug use.","5A"
2013,8415912,"5 R01 MH069229-10","Over the last quarter century, substantial progress has been made in effecting purposeful behavioral change  to reduce HIV/AIDS risk. Nevertheless, specific demographic and socio-geographic sub-groups remain at  high risk and substantial challenges in maintaining purposeful behavioral change persist. Among those  groups remaining at high risk are adolescents and young adults, persons of color, and individuals residing in  transitional and developing countries. Challenges that have continued to confront behavioral risk reduction  interventions include: a) waning intervention effects over time; b) changing environmental exposures and  responses thereto that occur during adolescence; and c) the resource intensive nature of multiple session  behavioral interventions especially in resource poor settings such as developing and transitional countries.  This competitive renewal of R01MH069229 will focus on a particularly high risk population (youth of  African descent attending Grade 10 in government high schools in The Bahamas, a nation with an HIV sero-  prevalence of 3%) and proposes a four-cell, randomized, controlled trial designed to address each of the four  challenges outlined above, building upon our ongoing research. During the past 4.5 years in our current  funding period, the US-Bahamian research team has been evaluating the Bahamian adaptation of a 10-  session adolescent HIV prevention program entitled  Focus on Youth in The Caribbean  (FOYC) and the 1-  hour adapted parental monitoring intervention entitled  Caribbean Informed Parents and Children Together   (CImPACT) through a randomized, controlled three-celled trial involving 1360 Grade 6 youth and 1175 of  their parents. Beginning at the 6 months follow-up and extending through 24  months follow-up, condom-use, condom-use intention, and relevant perceptions and knowledge were  significantly higher among FOYC youth compared to control youth. Despite the efficacy of FOYC, the  and 36 (preliminary data)  actual rates among both FOYC and control youth are concerningly low (e.g. condom-use rates at 24 months  and 36 months was 30% and 40% among FOYC youth and 20% and 25% among controls). Therefore, the  Department of Education of The Bahamas and the US-Bahamian Research Team seek to identify an  effective intervention that can be delivered to Grade 10 students in The Bahamas. In the research described  in this submission, we propose to: a) Recruit 2600 youth (and their parents) from 172 Grade 10 FHLE  classrooms over two years from all 7 government high schools in New Providence, The Bahamas; b)  Randomly assign at the level of the classroom 2400 youth (and their parents) from 160 classes to one of  four intervention conditions: 1) HFLE only (no parent intervention); 2) BFOOY only (no parent  intervention); 3) BFOOY plus ImPACT (delivered to parent-youth dyads with a six month parent booster);  or 4) BFOOY plus GFI (delivered to parent-youth dyads with a six month parent booster); c) Randomly  assign one of the seven high schools (with ~12 HFLE classes and ~200 students) to a  control school   condition to explore possible class-to-class contamination within schools; d) Assess intervention effects on  the entire sample at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post-intervention (and among parents at 6 and 12 months); and  e) Conduct sub-group analyses to explore: i) the impact of interventions received at two critical junctures  during adolescence; ii) the effect of being part of a longitudinal trial on risk/protective behaviors; and iii) the  extent of intervention contamination if the unit of randomization is the class rather than the school.","5A"

Patterns of heightened levels of drug use among MSM (compared to their heterosexual peers) in the CDA project lead us to focus on this sub-population as one of particular concern. Although this renewal project will build on our existing research, and will specifically compare drug using patterns and processes with the CDA parent project, the proposed project is a separate endeavor with a significant change in focus.  We will focus on the following research questions: 1.) What are the patterns, variations and combinations of club drug use among AAMSM and how do they compare with the larger Asian American sample in the CDA project? 2.) What are the social processes of club drug use, including initiation, motivation, rituals, and perceptions among young AAMSM in the club/party scenes in the San Francisco Bay Area? 3.) What is the relationship between young AAMSM club-drug use and HIV/sexual risk behaviors? 4.) What are the various social contexts in which young AAMSM use club drugs and how do these contribute to patterns of drug use and risky behavior 5.) What is the relationship between constructions of sexual and ethnic identities and drug-use or sexual-risk practices and beliefs?  We will locate and interview 240 young AAMSM, age 18-30, who have used one or more club drugs, three or more times in the previous 6 months. The sample will be subdivided into 1/3 foreign-born and 2/3 American-born AAMSM. We have also established flexible recruitment targets for respondents on the basis of the ethnonational composition of the San Francisco Bay Area Asian American population as a whole. However, after an initial mapping of participation in the scene, the sampling frame will be modified to reflect the population of AAMSM involved in the club scene. We will use primarily qualitative methods, including ethnographic observation, and key-informant and in-depth interviewing. Interviews will include a structured questionnaire to gather sociodemographic and key quantitative data, and an open-ended, semi-structured schedule to provide detailed narrative information. Analysis will consist of mixed methods appropriate to the various types of data collected. This project is important because Asian American MSM are an understudied population, and one that may be at great risk for both drug use and for HIV/sexually transmitted infections. The project can contribute to existing research through its analysis of intersections of ethnicity, sexuality, and drug consumption and its emphases on culture, identity, and social context - all understudied issues in the extant literature.","5B"
2013,8415922,"5 R01 AI081615-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Given the limited genetic coding capacity of HIV-1, it is reasonable to expect that the virus must interact with an extensive battery of cellular factors to complete its passage through the cell. Indeed, it is remarkable that the viral genome, comprising only about 0.0003% of the entire genetic capacity of the cell, commandeers the cellular environment to its own advantage. However, to date and despite being easily the most studied virus, only a relatively small group of cellular proteins have been shown essential for HIV-1 propagation. A genetic/proteomic approach has been developed that utilizes a random mutagenic protocol followed by a stringent step of biological selection in efforts to pinpoint those rare sites within the HIV-1 proteome that can accommodate the incorporation of a potent affinity tag without significant loss of those structure/function relationships that are required for viral replication-competency. In conjunction with a novel cryogenic methodology to capture and preserve transient viral-host interactions during immunoisolation, we have recovered several host proteins in association with the replicating virus but previously obscured from conventional scientific investigation. We are reassured that our method is sound since among the cellular proteins recovered and identified using our methodologies are those previously determined by other groups to interact with HIV-1. Furthermore, a straightforward mass spectrometric technique is presented that discriminates with high accuracy between specific and nonspecific proteins in immunoisolated protein complexes. The combined genetic and proteomic method described is a powerful tool set that can be utilized to identify cellular proteins in transient association with a given viral protein at points during the viral life cycle, a subset of which may be absolutely required by the virus for its livelihood but in part, dispensable by the host cell.","2B"
2013,8415926,"5 R01 AI083279-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): T cell activation involves the integration of several signals. In addition to antigen specific signaling through the T cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory signaling through molecules such as CD28, signaling through additional molecules including the transmembrane receptor Notch are critical at many stages of T cell activation and development. To identify novel molecules that regulate T cell activation, we used a genetic approach to rescue the T cell activation defect in a Jurkat mutant cell line by retroviral expression of a leukocyte library. In our initial screen, we found that retroviral expression of NKAP complemented the defect in one Jurkat mutant cell line and restored T cell activation. We have demonstrated that NKAP is a novel negative regulator of Notch signaling that associates with CIR, which is part of the Notch co-repressor complex. To determine the function of NKAP in vivo, we generated mice with a floxed NKAP allele. Lck-cre NKAP conditional knockout mice have a severe block in ??T cell development at the DN3/2-selection checkpoint, although ??T cell development proceeds normally. Interestingly, mice deficient in either NcoR or mSin3a, two generic components of transcriptional corepressor complexes, also have a DN3 block during T cell development, indicating that epigenetic changes are required as cells pass the ?-selection checkpoint to become DP T cells. As predicted, examination of three Notch target genes, CD25, Deltex1 and Hes1 by QPCR demonstrated that NKAP lck-cre cKO DP T cells had increases in gene expression by 8- to 20-fold, proving that the NKAP functions as a negative regulator of Notch signaling in vivo, and is required for T cell development. Analysis of T cell development in CD4-cre NKAP cKO mice demonstrates a block within SP thymocytes as they progress from semimature to mature. In addition, there are decreased numbers of T cells in the periphery in CD4-cre NKAP cKO mice, and these naive T cells express markers consistent with being recent thymic emigrants, indicating that NKAP also plays a critical role in T cell maturation. This proposal will focus on understanding the function of NKAP during T cell development and maturation, to uncover how altered gene regulation in the absence of NKAP alters T cell development and to define the mechanism whereby loss of NKAP leads to upregulation of Notch target genes. Specific Aim #1: Regulation of T cell development and maturation by NKAP Specific Aim #2: Mechanism of altered gene expression in the absence of NKAP","2C"

During the award period, I will build expertise in the methodology and conduct of clinical investigation, infectious disease modeling and economic evaluation. My career development plan combines formal didactics with relevant research experiences that address global HIV/TB priorities. A cross-disciplinary team of recognized leaders in HIV /TB research will provide professional and scientific mentorship during this phase of career development. Research: Effective control of TB and MDR-TB in HIV patients is hindered by low case-detection rates. Intensified Case Finding (ICF) of TB is advocated by the WHO as a strategy for HIV/TB control, but critical knowledge gaps exist. First, it is unknown if ICF of TB in HIV patients will increase case-detection and reduce HIV/TB mortality. Second, the optimal usage of emerging, rapid TB diagnostic tools as part of future ICF algorithms is not clear. Finally, the cost-effectiveness of novel ICF interventions has yet to be elucidated. The Aims of this proposal are: 1) To determine the impact of standardized TB ICF on HIV patient outcomes. ICF using a standardized TB screening/diagnostic strategy recently recommended by the WHO will be implemented for a longitudinal cohort of HIV patients in Uganda. TB case-detection and HIV/TB mortality rates will be assessed using a pre/post study design. 2) To determine the comparative- effectiveness of ICF algorithms that utilize new rapid TB diagnostic tools. We will evaluate the comparative accuracy of the urine LAM-ELISA, Lateral-Flow LAM, and Cepheid Xpert rapid diagnostic tests among TB suspects in Uganda. Decision-analysis will be used to estimate the accuracy, efficiency, and yield of ICF algorithms that incorporate combinations of these tools [with/without conventional diagnostics] either serially and/or in parallel. 2) To model the impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of incorporating novel, rapid TB diagnostics into ICF algorithms. We will model the impact of novel ICF interventions on population TB incidence, prevalence, and mortality in HIV-prevalent regions, and perform an economic evaluation to guide cost-effective placement of novel, rapid TB diagnostics in the health system. Environment: Johns Hopkins University offers substantial intellectual and physical resources. The Division of Infectious Diseases has over 50 full-time faculty including leaders in international HIV and TB research. The JH Center for TB Research further provides a unique research infrastructure with multi-disciplinary faculty, extensive international partnerships, and over 5,500 square feet of new lab and office space. Johns Hopkins Public Health School is the largest such institution in the world and offers intensive coursework in all aspects of clinical research design, management, and analysis, including economic evaluation of health interventions.

This Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) consists of an administrative base at JHU and two Kampala clinical research sites (CRS). The MU-JHU Research Collaboration site will be affiliated with both the IMPAACT and the Microbicide Network applications, focusing on HIV prevention and treatment in women and children. The Infectious Diseases Institute site will be affiliated with the HPTN Network application with a focus on HIV prevention in adults. Both sites also have the capacity to expand to other network areas such as HIV vaccine end treatment studies. The clinical, data management, laboratory, and administrative resources and expertise necessary to screen, enroll, and retain HIV infected and uninfected participants in HIV prevention and treatment trials are currently available. The presence of the shared CAP-certified laboratory, community advisory boards, strong regulatory/QC sections, and local Ugandan IRB oversight coupled with extensive clinical trials experience will insure that all research is conducted to the highest scientific and ethical standards. The longstanding (>17 yr) relationship between JHU and MU investigators and support of the Uganda Ministry of Health has created a strong, productive, and mutually beneficial international center for HIV research that will be able to continue and expand through the funding of this application.        Uganda has been at the forefront in HIV education, programs, and research in response to their devastating epidemic. However, rates of HIV infection in the 45,000 women in the Mulago hospital antenatal clinics yearly remain high (~11%), with transmission to neonates during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Women are economically and socially disadvantaged with limited capacity to protect themselves against infection. Access to HIV therapy is expanding, but lack of medical infrastructure and human capacity presents an ongoing challenge. Preventing HIV infection in adults and children and providing access to care to those infected is a worldwide public health crisis. The goal of this research unit is to find practical and affordable ways to accomplish this in a setting with limited resources.         ADMINISTRATIVE COMPONENT:","3D,3F,6B,6E,6F"

There is great current interest in potential strategies for eliminating this reservoir. During the previous funding period, we have carried out mechanistic studies that have led to a reevaluation of current models of latency and have shown that mechanisms of latency are most accurately analyzed in primary cell systems rather than in transformed T cell lines. We developed an in vitro system in which primary resting CD4+ T cells carrying latent HIV-1 genomes can be generated. In this proposal, we describe the use of this system to identify and characterize small molecules capable of reactivating latent HIV-1 for use in efforts to eradicate this reservoir. We have already identified one promising hit which we will characterize mechanistically. In addition, we will use this system to explore key unanswered questions regarding the dynamics of the latent reservoir, focusing on issues that are important for eradication strategies. The Specific Aims are (1) to determine the mechanism by which the identified hit (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) reactivates latent HIV-1, (2) to use the novel latency model in primary resting CD4+ T cells to screen selected small molecule libraries for other agents that reactivate latent HIV-1 without inducing global T cell activation, (3) to carry out a comparative in vitro evaluation of the efficacy of agents that reactivate latent HIV-1, and (4) to use the primary cell model to explore mechanisms involved in the maintenance of HIV-1 latency.","2B"
2013,8415961,"5 R01 AI080290-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 drug resistance seriously impacts treatment options for infected individuals. It is recommended that HIV-1 infection be treated with combination antiretroviral therapy containing at least two classes of drugs. A combination of 2 nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NRTIs) and 1 nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI) is commonly used. During treatment, HIV-1 can acquire mutations that allow escape from inhibition by antiretroviral drugs. Drug resistant viruses can be stable within the host for long periods of time and can be transmitted horizontally or vertically to new individuals. However, the sites of origin and persistence of drug resistance within individuals over time has not been studied in depth. We hypothesize that drug resistant viruses will emerge multifocally in tissues, such as mucosal sites, the central nervous system, and lymph nodes, before resistance is seen in blood and will persist for longer periods of time as compared to blood. We also propose that differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antiretrovirals in these anatomic compartments strongly influence the selection and persistence of drug resistance.  Nonhuman primate models have been useful in studying AIDS pathogenesis and immunology, using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Because NNRTIs do not inhibit SIV, these drugs cannot be studied in the SIV model. Therefore, we developed a macaque model to study HIV-1 drug resistance in vivo. This model uses macaques infected with a pathogenic chimeric virus consisting of SIVmne containing the HIV-1HxB2 RT coding region (RT-SHIVmne). In Specific Aim 1, we propose to longitudinally examine the emergence of drug- resistant RT-SHIVmne in the blood and in different anatomical compartments that arise during NRTI or NNRTI monotherapy. Because HIV-1 persists in cellular and tissue reservoirs even during suppressive antiretroviral therapy, we propose in Specific Aim 2 to determine the origin of the re-emergence of wild-type virus and persistence of drug-resistant virus after discontinuation of monotherapy and after initiation of antiretroviral therapy using a regimen of all new drugs or one that includes the drug used in monotherapy in the infected animals. To explore whether site-specific differences in the emergence of drug resistant viruses are explained by different site-specific drug concentrations, we propose in Specific Aim 3 to examine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the antiretrovirals in the blood and tissues during and after therapy.  The proposed studies are difficult to execute in humans but can be readily performed in our RT-SHIVmne model of antiretroviral therapy and drug resistance. These experiments will provide new insights into the anatomic origin of drug resistance, its persistence on and off antiretroviral therapy, and the influence of site- specific variation in antiretroviral pharmacokinetics. This work should help determine better strategies for treating HIV-infected individuals, particularly those harboring and potentially transmitting drug resistant virus.","6A"
2013,8415965,"5 R37 AI048638-13","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central problem in immunology is how the immune system launches robust immunity against invading pathogens, while maintaining tolerance to self. This problem assumes a particular significance in the intestine because of the trillions of commensal microorganisms and food antigens that confront the intestinal immune system every day. Recent advances suggest that dendritic cells (DCs) play a fundamental role in maintaining the balance between immunity and tolerance. We now know that there are multiple subpopulations of DCs that differentially regulate the immune response, and that these subsets display tremendous functional plasticity in response to instructive signals from microbes and microenvironments. In this context, our recent work suggests that DCs and macrophages in the lamina propria of the intestine differentially regulate Th17 versus T regulatory responses, and that a dynamic interplay between DCs and macrophages maintains a balance between immunity and tolerance. However, there are multiple subpopulations of DCs in the lamina propria. This raises several fundamental questions: (i) What roles do the distinct DC subsets play in regulating immunity versus tolerance? (ii) Are the functions of these cells fixed, or are they plastic? (iii) To what extent do commensals shape the function of DCs in the intestine? (iv) How can oral vaccines target intestinal DCs to stimulate optimally effective mucosal immunity? The present grant will address these questions in the following specific aims: Aim 1: To determine whether distinct subsets of lamina propria DCs and macrophages differentially bias the class of innate and adaptive immune responses Aim 2: To determine whether commensal bacterial flora regulate the functions of lamina propria DCs and macrophages and their ability to induce Th17 versus T regulatory responses Aim 3 : To determine the innate responses of lamina propria DCs and macrophages to oral administration of adjuvants or vaccines, and the effects of such responses on the adaptive immune response The successful completion of these aims will provide fundamental mechanistic insights into how the immune system maintains a balance between immunity and tolerance, and provide new strategies for modulating mucosal immunity to control autoimmunity, or to protect against oral infections.","2C,4A"
2013,8416256,"5 R01 NR012962-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application tests a theory-based HIV treatment adherence intervention delivered by cell phone to patients in urban and rural areas. Adherence to antiretroviral (ART) medications is necessary to achieve HIV suppression and non-adherence can lead to treatment resistant genetic variants of HIV. People living with HIV/AIDS often experience difficulty sustaining high-levels of treatment adherence. Most factors that interfere with adherence are unanticipated and occur between clinical visits, including depression, side effects, substance use, and lapses in pharmacy refill. We will conduct a randomized clinical trial to test a cell phone-delivered theory-based medication adherence counseling intervention. The intervention is grounded in Self-Regulation Model and utilizes unannounced pill counts to monitor adherence and guide corrective feedback within the counseling context. Using pill count adherence information for counseling allows providers to detect and correct patient non-adherence within a time frame that can head off viral resistance. An experimental factorial design will test the effects of counseling and a text message reminder system as well the interaction of counseling and text message components with 600 men and women receiving HIV treatment. Following screening, informed consent and baseline assessments participants will be randomized to one of four intervention conditions:(a) self-regulation counseling + regimen tailored text message reminders; (b) self-regulation counseling + control messages; (c) control counseling + regimen tailored text reminders; or (d) control counseling + control messages. The study will therefore use a 2 (self-regulation counseling) x 2 (text message reminders) full factorial deign with participants followed for 12 months post-intervention. The primary endpoints are medication adherence assessed by unannounced pill counts and HIV RNA (viral load). This newly developed intervention strategy is grounded in Self-Regulation Theory and is designed for use in clinical settings with limited resources.","5A,5B"
2013,8416270,"5 R01 DA029488-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nationally, rates of HIV among African American men who have sex with women (MSW) in both rural and urban areas are nearly 10 times as high as those reported for Caucasian MSW and have increased annually since 2004. This increase is particularly evident in small towns and rural communities in the South. The years following high school are a critical period when rural African American MSW are particularly vulnerable to engaging in behaviors that increase their risk for HIV and other STIs. Few attend college and, in the rural South, job opportunities that lead to stable occupations are scarce. With no stake in conventional educational or occupational systems, the transition to the workforce can be demoralizing and protracted. Some who see no pathway to adequate subsistence or attainment of personal goals may experience increases in anger and other negative emotions that encourage substance use; undermine stable, monogamous relationships; and compromise protective sexual behavior. Based on the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) prescription for prevention science, the development of effective prevention programs requires etiological models that link contextual factors with proximal risk and protective mechanisms that forecast HIV-related risk behavior in a specified target population. Currently, this information does not exist for African American MSW in general or rural MSW in particular. Although program developers may create or adapt programs for rural African American MSW without the necessary scientific data, implementing programs that are not based on sound etiological models will undermine their public health impact. Consistent with IOM recommendations, the proposed research will provide the necessary next step for the development of efficacious HIV prevention interventions for rural African American MSW during young adulthood.  We propose to sample 500 rural African American men age 18-21 who live in a region of central Georgia typical of areas in the rural South with large proportions of African American residents. Men from this region will provide survey data 3 times at 12-month intervals. The conceptual model that guides the study incorporates the following processes: (a) contextual risk factors including economic opportunities and stressors, racial discrimination, and risk-promoting peer affiliations and norms; (b) proximal risk mechanisms including negative emotionality, risk-promoting masculine ideology, and sexual relationship dynamics; (c) protective factors including racial pride, self-regulatory competence, and risk-deterring relationships with parents and informal mentor figures, and (d) HIV-related behaviors including substance use, unprotected intercourse, and multiple and concurrent sexual partnerships.","5B"

The collaboration between the clinical trial unit, 37 public hospitals and the Ministry of public Health resulted in the completion of two major PMTCT studies that form the basis of the WHO and Thai national guidelines on PMTCT. Following previous collaboration with PACTG, the PHPT-CTU will continue to address outstanding issues that have been targeted by the IMPAACT leadership network. Within the context of rapid scale up of antiretroviral treatment programs in Thailand, PHPT has started a treatment monitoring strategy trial (PHPT-3) and organized a structured follow up of a large cohort of patients on treatment, and strengthened the involvement of the communities in these research activities. Therefore another area of focus for the PHPT CTU will be optimization of treatments in adults and adolescents.   The organization of PHPT has demonstrated its ability to successfully conduct large clinical trials. The PHPT group has selected the 10 strongest clinical research sites to implement international studies with the leadership networks. These sites have access to large affected populations and have the expertise and infrastructure to carryout these studies, as well as contributing to the research agenda of the networks. The participation in the networks will add to the existing international collaborations to provide an environment conducive to the promotion of new investigators and clinical research staff in Thailand to sustain HIV research efforts. The research agenda to which the PHPT-CTU intends to contribute will have a major public health impact not only in Thailand but also for all communities affected by HIV. The sites participating in this research are Bhumibol Adulyadej Hospital, Chonburi Hospital, Hat Yai Hospital, Maharaj Nakorriratchasrima Hospital, Nakhonpathom Hospital, Nakornping Hospital, Phayao Provincial Hospital, Drapokklao Hospital, Samutprakarn Hospital, and Samutsakorn Hospital.   This research aims to develop more effective ways of preventing HIV infection in children and to improve methods to treat HIV infected adults, adolescents and children.

The SU CTU has three Clinical Research Sites (CRS) that operate in a well integrated fashion and an established referral system from regional hospitals, community health clinics and mid-wife obstetric units. The Children's Infectious Diseases (KIDCRU) CRS and the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) CRS were established through the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trial Group (PACTG) and presently recruiting subjects into three transition studies (2 pediatric and 1 PMTCT). One pediatric study determines the role of isoniazid in preventing tuberculosis (P1041). The PMTCT study addresses the optimal time for HIV testing for pregnant women presenting for labor (P1031). Both studies will accrue subjects in the transition phase in excess of the 20 patient average per month required for each site. The KIDCRU CRS is planning two additional transition studies: 1. Antiretroviral (ARV) strategy trial which will provide critical information for the national ARV program (P390) and, 2. Hepatitis B vaccine study for adolescents, which will provide useful information and a nucleus for an adolescent research program (ATN024). The KIDCRU CRS; and PMTCT CRS have been invited to affiliate with the IMPAACT Network. The SU CTU has the support of expert consultants in adolescence, neonatology, childhood TB and pediatric neurology from the SU Faculty of Health Sciences, who will contribute to protocol development and study implementation.

Using laser capture microdissection we have isolated single CD8+ DEJ T cells in situ and interrogating these cells with transcriptional arrays and quantitative RT PCR assays. Our data indicates these cells express a wide variety of cytolytic and antiviral cytokines, as well as a unique homodimeric ?? chain signature. We have also developed rigorous and specific sampling methods to precisely pinpoint the sites of HSV-2 reactivation in the genitalia in time and space. Our preliminary data have shown wide differences in the number of CD8+ DEJ T cells in areas of genital skin. We now propose to apply these and other advanced methodologies to understand the immune surveillance mechanism of HSV-2 specific CD8+ T cells. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will probe the relationship between immunosurveillance and duration, severity, and frequency of HSV-2 reactivation. We hypothesize that the number of CD8+ T cells and/or their levels of expression of cytolytic and antiviral cytokines/chemokines will be inversely correlated with frequency of HSV-2 reactivation. Areas in which DEJ CD8+ T cells are in low numbers or express low functional activity will have a greater likelihood of reactivation than areas which are populated with high CD8+ T cells at the DEJ. We will also explore the relationships between clonal diversity and reactivation. Aim 2 is directed at defining host-viral interactions among HIV+ persons. We hypothesize that HIV+ persons will exhibit altered quantitative and functional differences in immune surveillance and that these differences will be reflected in poorer containment of HSV-2. The comparisons between HIV+/HSV-2+ and HIV-/HSV-2+ persons will provide further evidence of the importance of CD8+ T cells at the DEJ in immune surveillance and corroborate the mechanistic functions define in S.A. 1.","1B"

Numerous studies have demonstrated anti-HIV effects of short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting various HIV genes. However, constitutive gene silencing by administration of siRNAs or shRNAs may lead to various problems including off-target effects, emergence of escape virus mutants, and immunological complications. Therefore, conditional RNAi strategies that respond to the HIV derived or related factors would have profound implications in HIV research and therapy. At present, conditional expression of shRNAs from engineered promoters incorporating the trans-activating region (TAR) of HIV is the only major strategy that affords HIV-inducible RNAi. We propose to develop an alternative strategy for conditional RNAi responsive to the HIV proteins Tat or Rev based on our engineered RNA architecture that enable posttranscriptional activation of RNAi via allosteric hammerhead ribozyme. Specific Aims of the proposed research are as follows: Specific Aim 1: To engineer allosteric hammerhead ribozymes (aptazymes) that are activated by the HIV proteins Tat and Rev by incorporating natural and synthetic RNA ligands in the hammerhead ribozyme. Specific Aim 2: To demonstrate conditional gene silencing with engineered shRNAs incorporating the aptazymes in cultured cells.  This R21 proposal will focus on demonstrating the feasibility of HIV Tat or Rev inducible gene silencing in human cell culture based on our original RNA architecture.

Antimalarial drugs are the mainstay of malaria control, but the spread of parasite resistance to most antimalarials is of grave concern. To address this concern, concerted efforts have been directed at discovering and developing new antimalarial drugs, with some encouraging early results. Yet, it is clear that for the foreseeable future we would need to feed the pipeline of antimalarials, because resistance to new drugs is sure to arise. Recently, we have discovered a series of compounds with a pyrazole core that demonstrate highly potent antimalarial activity. These compounds are undergoing the process of development as an antimalarial drug with a novel structure. Our data also suggest that their mode of action is likely to target a vital and a hitherto unknown vulnerable pathway in malaria parasites. By applying a variety of approaches, we propose to uncover the nature of this pathway and its molecular components. The aims we propose here will use both empirical and hypothesis-driven approaches to identify molecular mechanisms underlying this promising series of compounds. We will employ a variety of methods to assess changes occurring in P. falciparum blood stages as they are rapidly being killed by the pyrazole compounds. These will include: phosphoprotein profiling, transcriptome changes, changes in metabolites, calcium homeostasis, and morphological changes at both light and electron microscopic levels. These studies will provide clues, as well as confirmation, regarding the pathways affected by the compounds. Recent studies suggest that pyrazoles and another series of potent antimalarials, spiroindolones, may be working through a common pathway. We will assess common features in mode of action of these two chemically distinct compounds. We will test a hypothesis that the pyrazole compounds are targeting a pathway similar to phosphorylation regulatory mechanisms observed in plants. This hypothesis is based on our initial observation of mutations discovered through whole genome sequencing of resistant parasites that we found to be important in imparting the resistance phenotype. Overall, these studies has the potential not only to understand mechanism of action for promising antimalarials but also to reveal new targets for future investigations.)","6D"
2013,8416319,"5 R21 AI098431-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) has been remarkably effective for managing HIV infection / AIDS. However, patient compliance with HAART is often variable due to treatment- related complications. This is a serious problem that facilitates the emergence of drug resistance. One issue that contributes to HAART-associated complications is the poor metabolic stability and low cellular penetration of the HIV protease inhibitors. Our group has been exploring a new method for addressing these limitations. This strategy is directly inspired by the pharmacological properties of the natural product, FK506, which has a surprisingly long halftime in humans (t1/2 ~ 40 hrs) despite being an excellent substrate for P450 enzymes in vitro. We recently wondered whether this apparent contradiction might arise from this compound's high affinity for the FK506-binding protein (FKBP). Blood cells, including both erythrocytes and leukocytes, express unusually high levels of FKBP but they are virtually devoid of P450 enzymes. Therefore, we hypothesized that affinity-driven accumulation within this protected cellular niche might limit exposure to key metabolic enzymes and, thereby, extend drug lifetime. Moreover, FK506 is rapidly absorbed (~1 hr), highly penetrant to biological membranes and naturally targeted to leukocytes via its FKBP-binding moiety. Together, these properties appear to align with the major problems facing HIV protease inhibitors. Based on these observations, we tethered an FKBP-binding group to an amprenavir analog, creating a bifunctional molecule that can bind both FKBP and HIV protease. We found that the resulting compound retained anti-protease activity (IC50 ~ 20 nM). Moreover, it was now sequestered into blood cells (by at least 8-fold) and its half-life was increased by ~ 20-fold in mice. The lifetime of this compound was superior to that of ritonavir-boosted amprenavir and, moreover, its metabolic stability was now independent of ritonavir co-administration. Based on these promising initial findings, we now propose to carefully explore the molecular mechanisms governing this behavior. Specifically, we reason that cellular partitioning and lifetime are dictated, in part, by the affinity of the compound for FKBP. To explore this central hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: (1) synthesize a collection of FKBP-binding amprenavir derivatives and measure their relative affinities for albumin, FKBP and HIV protease and (2) explore how cellular partitioning correlates with binding affinities and relative protein expression levels. From these observations, we expect to understand the key structure-activity relationships in the context of the ternary complex (i.e. FKBP-drug-HIV protease). The immediate goal of this study is to create potent, safe and long-lived HIV protease inhibitors that selectively target FKBP-expressing, HIV-infected cells. This study is significant because it addresses an important problem in the treatment of AIDS. The proposed work is innovative because it will explore a fundamentally new,  natural product-inspired  strategy.","6A"
2013,8416334,"5 R01 AI095113-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have demonstrated that CMV/SIV vectors can 1) re-infect CMV+ rhesus macaques (RM), 2) during re-infection, elicit potent and persistent SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses with a strong  effector memory  (TEM) bias, and 3) completely protect ~50% of vaccinated RM from progressive infection after limiting dose rectal challenge with the highly pathogenic SIVmac239 virus. The protection manifested in these RM is distinct from previous vaccines in its abruptness and extent, with protected RM exhibiting a viral burst in plasma of varying size upon initial infection, followed by immediate control to undetectable levels. Although occasional viral blips in plasma are observed in protected RM, these decline with time, and after 1 year, protection is unaffected by CD8+ or CD4+ cell depletion, and extensive tissue analysis with ultrasensitive nested PCR has shown only rare detection of ~ single copy SIV nucleic acid and no viable SIV. Protection correlates with the total SIV-specific CD8+ TEM generated during the vaccine phase, and occurs without an anamnestic response. These data indicate a novel pattern of protection consistent with very early control, likely taking place at the site of viral entry and/or early sites of viral replication and amplification, and involving tissue-resident CD8+ TEM. Thus, CMV vectors and the  TEM  vaccine concept offer a powerful new approach to HIV/AIDS vaccine development. However, fully replicative CMV vectors are unlikely to be advanced to human use due to the pathogenic potential of CMV. A central goal is therefore to develop CMV vectors that maintain immunogenicity and efficacy, but are safe to use in humans. Fortunately, preliminary data indicates that replication/spread-deficient CMVs can be robustly immunogenic. Here, we will explore the extent to which replication/spread-deficient CMV vectors can be attenuated with respect to pathogenicity and transmissibility, while retaining immunogenicity and efficacy. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) to design, construct and in vitro characterize replication/spread-deficient CMV/SIV vectors, 2) to determine the pathogenicity of replication/spread-deficient CMV/SIV vectors in fetal RM, and 3) to determine the immunogenicity and shedding of replication/spread-deficient CMV/SIV vectors in juvenile RM, and to take the optimal replication/spread deficient vector design to an efficacy trial to determine its ability to protect against limiting dose rectal SIVmac239 challenge.","4B"
2013,8416345,"5 R01 AI098637-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The continuing HIV/AIDS epidemic and the spread of multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has perpetuated an epidemic of tuberculosis in human populations around the world. While BCG is used universally as a vaccine, it is not effective in preventing pulmonary tuberculosis. To combat this ongoing worldwide scourge, vaccine development for tuberculosis is a priority. Apoptosis is an innate M¿ defense mechanism that limits bacterial replication and restricts dispersal of Mtb. Apoptosis also links innate and clonal immunity. DC present bacterial antigens packaged in apoptotic vesicles to T cells, leading to better T cell priming and protection in vivo. How apoptosis is regulated and restricts Mtb replication and whether it can be manipulated to enhance vaccination is the focus of this proposal. Innovation: The role of eicosanoids in immunity to mycobacteria is conserved in fish, mice and humans, highlighting their fundamental importance. Our published work on in vitro infected human M¿ and on in vivo infected mice establish apoptosis of Mtb infected M¿ as a critically important host defense mechanism against tuberculosis. The complexity of death pathways in Mtb infected M¿ has only recently been appreciated. Virulent Mtb induces lipoxin A4 (LXA4), inhibits prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis, blocks apoptosis, and promotes necrotic M¿ death. In contrast, PGE2 protects against necrosis and increases apoptosis. Why apoptosis acts as a host defense mechanism is not understood. Here we put forward a new hypothesis that it is not apoptosis per se that leads to control, but instead phagocytosis of Mtb infected apoptotic M¿ that is the crucial event. We predict: (1) phagocytosis by M¿ will contain the infection; and (2) phagocytosis by DC will lead to priming of na¿ve T cells. In addition to the eicosanoid pathways, the balance between IL-1¿ and type I IFN (IFN¿) is emerging as a second axis that affects innate and clonal immunity. We propose a new model in which LXA4 and IFN¿, both induced by Mtb, interact to inhibit innate immunity, while PGE2, IL-1¿ and TNF promote antibacterial immunity. Aims: In Aim 1, we will determine how eicosanoids regulate activation of infected macrophages and induce control of intracellular bacterial replication. In particular, we will determine how eicosanoids affect the balance between IL-1¿ and type I IFN (IFN¿), which is emerging as a second axis that affects innate and clonal immunity. In the second aim, we will test the hypothesis that it is not apoptosis per se that kills Mtb - rather it is the phagocytosis f infected apoptotic M¿ that restricts intracellular Mtb growth. Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, termed efferocytosis, is a major constitutive M¿ function; however, little is known about its role during infection. Finally, in the third aim, we will determine the relationship between eicosanoids apoptosis and clonal immunity. We hypothesize that the eicosanoid biosynthetic and cell signaling pathways can be pharmacologically manipulated to enhance apoptosis of infected M¿. By promoting apoptotic death, we hope to increase the safety and the efficacy of attenuated bacterial vaccines. We believe that a mechanistic understanding of how pro-apoptotic vaccines induce better immunity will lead to the development of better immunization strategies against tuberculosis and other diseases that are using mycobacterial vectors. Summary: A better understanding of how apoptosis and efferocytosis affect innate immunity to Mtb culminating in control of the bacterial replication and stimulation of T cell immunity will improve our understanding of TB pathogenesis and will lead to research into novel therapies. !","2D"

The chiefly encountered infections are in the respiratory tract, and disseminated.  The ability of the bacterium to survive in different environments in the host requires tight gene regulation.  During the past 4 years of this grant, we have unveiled a number of the complex aspects of M. avium interaction with the host, from the interaction between the bacterium and the host mucosa, to the ability to survive in macrophages and to disseminate.  Several virulence genes were identified and their functions characterized.  Many of the genes allow the bacterium to enter intestinal epithelial cells, and others are required for survival within macrophages.  The long-term goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms of interaction between the pathogen and host cells.  Our submission now contains proposed studies to explore the relationship between M. avium and macrophages. Our central hypothesis is that M. avium has specific strategies to subvert the host cells and that becoming aware of them will allow for improved means of prevention and treatment of M. avium-related diseases.  We propose to continue this work during the next funding period by evaluating:    1.  M. avium interference with macrophage killing mechanisms:  (a)  studying bacterial genes that participate in  modifying/interfering with the mycobacterial vacuole formation upon uptake into macrophages; (b)  studying  the mechanisms of action of genes associated with bacterial resistance to macrophage killing mechanisms;   2.  The mechanisms by which M. avium leaves apoptotic macrophages and spreads to surrounding  macrophages.","2D"
2013,8416356,"5 R01 AI047153-13","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the basis for viral fusion protein-induced membrane fusion with atomic-resolution detail. Fusion of viral and target cell membranes is a key step in infection for many viruses important in disease and a detailed understanding of fusion mechanisms will aid development of anti-viral therapeutics whose mode of action is fusion inhibition. Fusion proteins are also a target of viral vaccine development. The proposed research focuses on the gp41 and the hemagglutinin HA2 fusion proteins of the respective human immunodeficiency virus and influenza virus. These proteins are chosen because the viruses cause major human diseases and because the proteins serve as prototypes for other class I viral fusion proteins. There is particular emphasis on the N-terminal  fusion peptide  (FP) domains of the fusion proteins, which represent ~20-residue apolar regions at the N-termini of the proteins. Numerous biochemical and biophysical studies have shown that the FP plays a key role in fusion and that chemically synthesized peptides with the FP sequence can serve as useful model systems to understand some aspects of viral/target cell fusion.  The long-term objectives will be achieved with three specific aims. Aim 1 focuses on production of multi-mg quantities of large constructs of gp41 and HA2 proteins that contain FPs, including full-length HA2. In addition, gp41 constructs will be made which contain the C-terminal membrane-proximal external region (MPER) and viral transmembrane (TM) domains. MPER and TM are important in fusion and MPER is also an HIV vaccine target. Residue-specific conformation of the membrane-associated constructs will be determined with solid- state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) measurements of specific carbonyl (13CO) chemical shifts. There will be particular focus on: (1) testing whether structural models of FP and MPER from short peptide studies are valid for these regions in the large constructs; (2) correlating FP and MPER structure to the observed fusogenicity of the construct; and (3) examining whether the gp41 FP is close to either the MPER or TM. Occlusion of MPER by FP could reduce MPER efficacy as an immunogen. Aim 2 focuses on determining the membrane locations of FP, MPER, and TM regions in these large gp41 and HA2 constructs using SSNMR measurements of distances between protein 13CO and lipid or cholesterol 31P, 19F, or 2H. These experiments will test the general structure-function model that deep but not transmembrane FP membrane insertion correlates with greater membrane perturbation and more rapid fusion catalysis. Aim 3 focuses on determining the distribution of antiparallel registries of b sheet FP in several gp41 constructs with very different FP membrane locations and fusogenicities. The free energies of FP membrane insertion will be estimated for the observed registries and correlated with membrane locations and fusogenicities. The overall goal is to connect high-resolution FP structure, membrane insertion depth, and fusogenicity.","2B"
2013,8416362,"5 R21 AI099867-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During chronic infections such as those caused by HIV-1, hepatitis C virus, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, as well as during tumor outgrowth, antigen-specific CD8 T cells often progressively lose function in a step-wise manner. This loss of functional capacity, termed T cell exhaustion, represents an extreme state of differentiation which is characterized by an inability to elaborate key anti-viral effector activites and, in severe cases, culminates in deletion of the CD8 T cells. Defining how and why exhaustion develops, as well as determining the regulatory mechanisms that maintain this state, are significant as this may permit the development of new strategies to enhance immunity to infections which are difficult to control. This exploratory proposal is built on a foundation of preliminary data from acute infection studies showing that if ICAM-1 is not expressed, then there is greatly enhanced retention of virus-specific effector phenotype CD8 T cells well into the memory phase, even though the infection is cleared. This is significant as preserving this population during chronic viral infections may impede the development of exhaustion and favor viral control. Nevertheless, virtually no information is available regarding the roles of adhesion molecules in dictating the development of T cell exhaustion. Since continuous antigenic activation is required to develop and sustain exhaustion, it is plausible that adhesion molecule interactions amplify the strength of the antigen-dependent signals that the virus-specific CD8 T cell receives, driving the development of exhaustion. This concept, that ICAM-1 interactions influence the differentiation state of the responding T cells, is supported by our preliminary findings. Based upon these findings, as well as published studies of exhausted CD8 T cells, we have formulated the hypothesis that ICAM-1 interactions enhance antigenic signals, and potentiate the development and maintenance of CD8 T cell exhaustion. Testing this hypothesis will provide novel information regarding how T cell exhaustion is controlled and will also determine whether targeting adhesion molecule interactions is a viable therapeutic option during chronic infections. Our specific aims are: (1) Define the requirements for ICAM-1 and LFA-1 in the development of CD8 T cell exhaustion; and (2) Determine whether targeting ICAM-1 interactions is a viable therapeutic option. Completion of the aims of this exploratory proposal will provide novel mechanistic insights into the roles of adhesion molecules in driving and sustaining CD8 T cell exhaustion, and this information may broadly impact our understanding of how CD8 T cell differentiation is corrupted under conditions of chronic antigenic activation, as well as identify potential new therapeutic approaches.","2B"

Very few of these early lapsers are able to become consistently illicit opioid-free during their treatment, and often leave treatment and relapse to drug use with its attendant HIV risk. We propose that inability to tolerate the distress of opioid withdrawal and the negative affect associated with early abstinence are key factors in early illicit opioid lapse and subsequent buprenorphine treatment drop-out.  This proposal to prevent early lapse is designed to meet the Stage I objectives of the NIDA Behavioral Therapies Development Program. It will take place in two phases.  The Aims of the first phase (Stage Ia) of the project are:  - to develop, refine, and pilot test a Distress Tolerance (DT) treatment that utilizes skills based in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy with 10 buprenorphine initiators in an iterative manner to establish feasibility and acceptability.  The Aims of the second phase (Stage Ib) of the project are:  - to conduct a preliminary randomized trial with buprenorphine initiators (n=60) comparing the distress tolerance treatment (DT) to a health education (HE) comparison intervention, examining:  - the effects of DT on both short-and long-term illicit opioid use  - the effects of DT on time to first illicit opioid lapse and time to  buprenorphine treatment drop-out  - the effects f DT on HIV risk behaviors (e.g., sharing of drug injection  equipment).  This project will develop a well-specified and novel behavioral distress tolerance treatment for buprenorphine initiators to prevent early illicit opioid use lapse, treatment drop-out and return to HIV risk behaviors, the efficacy of which can be tested in future Stage II randomized clinical trials. This research projec will also contribute much- needed knowledge about the relationship between opioid withdrawal, negative affect, distress tolerance, and buprenorphine outcomes.","5A"
2013,8416367,"5 K23 AI093163-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Introduction: The poor fidelity of the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme leads to a significant sequence diversity across infected individuals. Although this complicates antiretroviral therapy, this diversity allows researchers to characterize relationships between sampled viruses using phylogenetic tools. Once the phylogenetic relationships of HIV sampled from infected individuals are characterized, socio-demographic data from the sampled individuals may be overlaid onto these phylogenetic relationships leading to inferred reconstruction of social networks that may create a better understanding of socio-demographic patterns and drivers of the sampled epidemic. Previous work has characterized some of the risk factors for HIV infection in both San Diego, CA and Tijuana, Mexico. We propose to utilize objective sequence data along with clinical and socio-demographic data to improve the understanding of the relationship of the HIV-1 sub-epidemics along the San Diego-Tijuana border. Methods: In this proposal, sequence, clinical, and socio-demographic data gathered from HIV positive individuals enrolled in seven different collaborating cohorts along the San Diego- Tijuana border will be combined for analysis. HIV pol sequence data will be collected from the collaborating cohorts or generated from blood samples provided by them. Socio-demographic and clinical data will be abstracted from the databases of the cohorts in a de-identified manner, except for location of residence. Maximum likelihood based methods will then be used to determine the phylogenetic structure (i.e. clustering) of the sampled sequences, and then associations between the clustering and socio-demographic variables will be assessed including: location of residence, HIV risk factors, drug resistance, duration of infection, cross- border movement, and others. We will next determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of the HIV epidemics across the border region using geographic information systems, and coalescent theory based Bayesian phylogeographic analyses. These analyses can incorporate temporal and geographic data into the prior estimations of phylogenetic structure so that the final results may identify temporal and spatial transmission 'hot spots'. In order to address privacy issues, all geographic data will be smoothed at the time of presentation so that identification of individuals will not be possible. We will also work closely with our bioinformatics colleagues to understand the limitations of our convenience data, and develop statistical techniques to make our findings generalizable. Conclusions: We anticipate that our findings will improve understanding of HIV transmission dynamics in this region so that prevention strategies can be designed and targeted more effectively.       This research project has two major aims: 1) to identify risk factors related to HIV transmission, and 2) identify temporal and spatial 'hot spots of transmission in the San Diego-Tijuana border region. These results will assist public health agencies in Mexico and the US to more efficiently develop appropriate and targeted intervention strategies to curb ongoing HIV transmission.","1A"
2013,8416374,"5 R01 DA019497-07","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Injection heroin use is a chronic problem that fuels the transmission of HIV/AIDS through risky injection behaviors. Methadone and buprenorphine can reduce heroin use and risky injection behavior; however, they have abuse potential, produce physical dependence, can produce lethal overdose, are highly regulated, and some patients simply do not want agonist treatment. Opiate detoxifications can serve as an alternative to agonist treatment, but many injection drug users relapse to heroin use and resume risky injection behaviors after detoxification. Vivitrol(R), an extended release formulation of naltrexone, was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of opioid dependence, but its clinical utility is uncertain given the reluctance of many opioid- dependent adults to maintain its long-term use, and the fact that some patients continue to use opiates while under naltrexone blockade. Our research in the first period of this grant showed that employment-based reinforcement can be highly effective in promoting long-term adherence to Vivitrol(R). Employment-based reinforcement may be ideally suited to address the limitations of extended release naltrexone by capitalizing on its potential to simultaneously reinforce naltrexone adherence and opiate abstinence. This grant will evaluate the effectiveness of employment-based reinforcement to simultaneously promote high rates of Vivitrol(R) adherence and increase opiate abstinence. In this 5-year study, we propose to evaluate the separate and combined effects of the FDA-approved formulation of extended release naltrexone (Vivitrol(R)) and employment- based reinforcement of opiate abstinence in promoting opiate abstinence and reducing risky injection behavior in recently detoxified, opioid-dependent, injection drug users. After an opioid detoxification and induction onto oral naltrexone, participants will be invited to attend the Therapeutic Workplace for 24 weeks (where they can work and earn wages) and will be randomly assigned to one of four groups that will differ in whether they receive Vivitrol(R), employment-based opiate abstinence reinforcement, both or neither. Participants in Vivitrol(R) conditions will be required take scheduled injections to work and earn wages. Participants exposed to opiate abstinence reinforcement will receive a temporary decrease in their workplace pay if they fail to provide an opiate-free urine sample. The study will assess the effects of the interventions on weekly opiate urinalysis results, and on measures of injection drug use and cocaine use. If this study shows that the combined use of Vivitrol(R) and employment-based reinforcement of adherence and opiate abstinence is effective in maintaining long-term opiate abstinence, this model of employment-based addiction pharmacotherapy could be integrated into community workplaces to disseminate the effective use of Vivitrol(R); it could be used to enhance the utility of other new antagonist-like addiction medications; and it could provide an effective means of reducing injection drug use in individuals who persist in injecting heroin and exposing themselves and others to the risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV infection due to their continued injection drug use and risky injection behaviors.","5A"

Both nucleoside and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors are used as effective drugs for treating AIDS, but success can be limited by the emergence of drug-resistant viral variants. Novel non-nucleoside RT inhibitors have been developed through structure-based methods, including the recently approved drug etravirine/TMC125/Intelence, and we propose to carry out crystallographic studies that could enable structure-guided improvement of additional classes of RT inhibitors. The proposed work will involve structure determination of wild-type and drug-resistant HIV-1 RT in the presence and absence of nucleic acid substrates and inhibitors. Structural studies of inhibitor will explore binding sites for known drugs (NRTIs and NNRTIs) as well as other potential drug targeting sites including the RNase H active site. Use of strategically modified protein and nucleic acids will enhance the efficiency and quality of the structural studies. The structures determined will enhance our understanding of mechanisms of polymerase and RNase H catalysis, inhibition, and of drug resistance.","6A"

The award will provide Dr. Hartigan-O'Connor with the support required to establish himself as an independent investigator providing leadership in understanding mechanisms of immune protection against HIV and other chronic infectious diseases. In particular, the award will allow Dr. Hartigan-O'Connor to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in mechanisms of immune regulation, particularly those involving regulatory T cells; (2) to become proficient in the translational aspects of designing, funding, and carrying out clinical trials, particularly cohort studies and interventional trials; (3) to develop study design skills that will allow testing of specific hypotheses in chronically-infected human patients; (4) to develop biostatistical skills allowing proper analysis of longitudinal and interventional studies of immunomodulatory agents in HIV-infected patients; and (5) to develop an independent research career focused on immune protection against HIV. To achieve these goals, Dr. Hartigan-O'Connor has assembled a mentoring team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. Joseph M. McCune, Chief of the Division of Experimental Medicine at San Francisco General Hospital, who conducts research into the immunopathogenesis of HIV disease, and three co-mentors: Dr. Steven Deeks, Director of the SCOPE cohort study; Dr. Jeffrey Bluestone, Director of the Immune Tolerance Network and an expert in mechanisms of immune regulation; and Dr. Jeffrey Martin, an expert in the design and statistical analysis of studies in chronically-infected patients. The goal of Dr. Hartigan-O'Connor's research project is to understand the mechanisms by which regulatory T cells (T-regs) influence T cell activation and effector immune responses in SIV/HIV-infected infants and adults. Dr. Hartigan-O'Connor will test immunoregulatory responses in infants and adults to determine whether optimal immunologic control of HIV/SIV requires a functional T-reg compartment that prevents generalized immune activation but lacks T-regs, such as HIV-specific T-regs, that interfere with virus-specific T cell responses. The aims of the proposal are to demonstrate the presence of SIV-specific suppressive activity in infected infants; to determine whether infant human T-regs exert greater control over HIV-specific CD4+ T cells than do adult T-regs; and to determine whether compromise of the functional T-reg compartment in adult humans predates and predicts subsequent loss of immunologic control. The public health problem addressed by this training proposal is failure of the body's immune responses to protect against HIV disease. Development of vaccines and therapies that protect against HIV is hampered by a limited understanding of the mechanisms by which the virus subverts effective immune responses. A long-term solution to the problem of HIV worldwide will not be found until the mechanisms that limit immune responses to the virus are understood and can be limited or controlled.","2C"

The research proposed here is designed to continue an ongoing investigation of how Nef enhances viral infectivity.  Preliminary data indicate that endosomal coat proteins termed adaptor protein (AP) complexes are key co-factors for the modulation of infectivity by Nef. The data also indicate that Nef affects viral entry into target cells, but this effect is not clearly attributable to an influence of Nef on the trafficking of Env. Finally, the data indicate that Nef is present at the plasma membrane within clathrin-coated pits. Overall, these data suggest that Nef modulates a currently unidentified transmembrane protein (or proteins) to enhance viral infectivity.  The experiments proposed herein are designed to test the role of the plasma membrane associated adaptor protein complex AP-2 in the enhancement of viral infectivity by Nef; to identify the host cell protein(s) whose modulation is the basis of infectivity-enhancement; and to define the role of these host proteins in viral entry and replication rate. Three specific aims are proposed to achieve these goals: 1) to determine whether AP-2 is a key Nef co-factor for the enhancement of viral infectivity using RNA interference and the expression of dominant negative proteins; 2) to identify and correlate specific changes induced by Nef in the host cell plasma membrane- and virion-proteomes; and 3) to validate candidate cellular proteins as mediators of Nef's virologic effects using RNA interference and protein overexpression during in vitro assays of viral infectivity, entry, and replication rate.","2B"
2013,8416400,"5 R01 AI043198-15","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main goal of this work is to understand the role of small RNAs and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes in creating innate immune response to viral infections. The human host is invaded by a wide range of microbial pathogens and has evolved a number of defensive mechanisms to survive these infections. In addition to adaptive immunity, it is becoming increasing clear that innate immunity plays an important role in protecting host organisms from infections. A number of pathogen-associated innate immune responses have been previously identified. Recent studies have revealed that an innate immune response mechanism against viral infections involve a protein family, APOBEC3 (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 3). APOBEC3 family proteins can restrict replication of exogenous retroviruses as well as well as Hepatitis B, a DNA virus that replicates through an RNA intermediate and inhibits replication of retrotransposons. APOBEC3G protein exhibits the most potent block to HIV-1 replication. A second innate immune mechanism of defense against viral infections in plants and invertebrates involves RNAi. However, very little is known about the RNA-based antiviral immunity mechanisms in mammals. In this proposed work, we will define the role of small RNAs, RNP complexes containing APOBEC3G, and their subcellular context in modulating the HIV-1 life cycle. We believe that these studies will provide fundamental insight into the function of APOBEC3 proteins and into the mechanism of RNA-based innate immunity against retroviruses. Small molecules that interfere with interactions between a viral protein and the A3G RNPs could provide new drugs for AIDS therapy.","2C"
2013,8416406,"5 R01 DA026770-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected individuals have a 10-fold higher risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) than HIV- seronegative individuals. In the general population, albuminuria is typically the earliest detectable marker of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and even very low levels of albuminuria are predictive of future cardiovascular events and mortality. Cross-sectional studies in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) indicate that the prevalence of albuminuria is 3- to 5-times higher in HIV-infected individuals than in HIV-seronegative persons. However, few data are available regarding the natural history of albuminuria over time or of the implications of albuminuria for loss of kidney function or cardiovascular disease in this population. We propose to conduct an intensive cohort study that includes equal numbers of HIV-infected and HIV-negative individuals with normal kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), recruited from the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort and the AIDS Link to the Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) study. These cohorts have high rates of illicit drug use and hepatitis C infection, which have been linked to increased CKD risk. Albuminuric subjects will be over-sampled, so that approximately equal numbers of albuminuric and normoalbuminuric subjects will be followed in the HIV-infected and HIV-negative groups. The aims of our study are to 1) determine the implications of HIV infection and albuminuria for changes in GFR (determined by serial measures of iohexol clearance) and for changes in carotid intima-media thickness (a surrogate marker of cardiovascular disease), 2) evaluate novel biomarkers of kidney injury and GFR in this population, and 3) assess potential pathogenic mechanisms of HIV-related CKD (including viral burden measured in urine and immune activation). Our plan to characterize longitudinal changes in GFR with a 'gold standard' measurement technique is novel and will be a key complement to the many studies of HIV-related CKD that are based on estimated GFR. Our proposal targets the natural history and pathogenesis of early-stage CKD in HIV-infected individuals, a phase of disease that is both understudied and potentially most amenable to intervention.","2E"
2013,8416408,"5 R01 DA031202-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a strong correlation between chronic drug use and increased susceptibility to HIV infection. Chronic drug users account for approximately one third of all cases of HIV in the USA and progression to AIDS is markedly accelerated in opiate drug abusers. Chronic immune activation with increased serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines is a hallmark of progressive disease. Recent studies show that elevated plasma endotoxin (LPS), a consequence of gut bacterial translocation, may be the likely cause of immune activation in HIV infection. A correlation has been found between immune activation and T cell activation/depletion. Interestingly, studies show that HIV patients that use intravenous heroin display higher serum levels of LPS when compared to non-drug using HIV infected patients. Similarly, we show in a murine model of drug abuse, higher circulating levels of endotoxin when compared to placebo treated animals. These effects are further potentiated in the TATtg mice. As observed in human patients, immune activation in these animal models were also prolonged and sustained. These results implicate a role for LPS in driving the disease progression in drug abusing HIV infected patients. Paradoxically, however, it is well documented that, prolonged LPS exposure leads to LPS tolerance with decreased LPS induced macrophage stimulation. Yet, sustained immune activation is a hallmark of disease progression in both HIV patients and in animal models of HIV. The mechanism underlying this discordant observation is a significant gap in knowledge. In LPS tolerance, transcriptional and translational repressive events combine to tightly regulate proinflammatory genes. More recently, microRNAs have been implicated as negative regulators controlling diverse biological processes at the level of post-transcriptional regulation. We show in preliminary data a significant induction of two key miRNAs, miR-155 and miR-146a in animals that are chronically treated with LPS. In contrast, both miR-155 and miR-146a are significantly down regulated in animals that are morphine or TAT treated. LPS activates Toll like receptor 4 to induce transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (32-34). LPS induction of miR-155 and miR-146a may act as negative feedback regulators of TLR4 expression and signaling thereby preventing excessive activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesize, that suppression of LPS induced induction of miR-155 and miR-146a, by Morphine and TAT, deregulates the inhibitory feedback loop resulting in sustained TLR4 expression and signaling (Fig. 1). In Specific aim 1: We will test the hypothesis that LPS induction of miR-155 inhibits TLR4 expression and establish that morphine and TAT-mediated attenuation of miR-155 results in greater and sustained TLR4 expression. Specific aim 2: We will test the hypothesis that LPS induction of miR-155 and miR-146a acts as negative feedback regulators of TLR4 signaling and morphine and TAT modulation of miR-155 and 146a results in persistent TLR4 signaling. Specific Aim 3: Determine the mechanism by which Morphine and TAT modulate LPS induced miR-155 and 146a expression. Specific Aim 4: Determine the mechanism and consequence of morphine and TAT modulation of LPS induced miR-155 and miR-146a in vivo using WT and Transgenic animal models. The results from these studies will allow for the development of new therapeutic strategies to attenuate immune activation and reverse HIV disease progression both in HIV infected patients and in HIV infected drug abusing population.","2B"

The CPCRA CTU will make significant contributions to the INSIGHT and HIV Prevention Trials (HPTN) networks, both in enrollment and in scientific expertise. Through INSIGHT, the CPCRA CTU will contribute to multiple, randomized clinical trials in order to help determine the optimal clinical management for persons who are HIV+. These trials include studies of those who are: highly-antiretroviral (ARV) experienced and for whom virologic suppression cannot be achieved and maintained; ARV-naive, with advanced HIV disease and presenting for care with an opportunistic infection; co-infected with HIV and hepatitis virus; or at moderate-to-high risk of cardiovascular disease. Through the HPTN, the CPCRA CTU will contribute to trials examining both behavioral and therapeutic interventions with behavioral and biologic outcomes, seeking to reduce HIV transmission and HIV transmission-risk behavior. Targeted populations include those who are HIV+, as well as those who are HIV- and at-risk for seroconversion, such as injecting-drug and cocaine users and others at risk for seroconversion through sexual contact.      The Executive Office of the CPCRA Clinical Trials Unit, located at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington DC, is an off-campus affiliate of the applicant institution, The George Washington University. The Principal Investigator and Executive Office staff provide oversight, central coordination, training and education, technical assistance, and regulatory support for its 137 CRSs, organized by region into 23 Site Coordinating Centers (SCCs) in the United States, Brazil, Canada, Peru, and South Africa. These sites have in care a cumulative, demographically diverse patient base of over 152,000 persons with HIV/AIDS.      HIV is a major public health problem around the world. It is important to find better ways to use the medicines that we have to treat HIV, so that people who are infected can live longer and healthier lives. It is also important to find better ways to stop the spread of HIV by doing studies with people who have HIV infection and people who don't have HIV but who are at risk for getting HIV infection.

2013,8416422,"5 R21 AI099704-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of drug-resistance in infectious diseases such as malaria demands efforts to identify new anti-infective agents. Targeting essential isoprenoid biosynthetic enzymes is a potential strategy for the development of new antimalarial agents. This application is focused on the invention of a chemical strategy to permit cellular uptake and efficient intracellular activation of two polar inhibitor classes targeting the late stage MEP pathway enzyme, IspG, and farnesylpyrophosphate synthase (FPPS). FPPS is potently inhibited by the clinically-used anti-osteoporosis agent, zoledronate, and emerging evidence suggests zoledronate exerts antiparasitic and antibacterial effects in vitro. However, the polyanionic nature of this bisphosphonate at physiologic pH prevents efficient cellular uptake into extraskeletal cells at clinically achievable serum concentrations. Similar challenges will exit in achieving high intracellular concentrations of linear diphosphate analogs designed to act as potent mechanism-based inhibitors of MEP pathway enzyme IspG, or other MEP pathway enzymes in which polyphosphorylated groups are essential components for inhibitor binding and recognition. This application proposes a novel chemical strategy to overcome these critical barriers. The proposed studies will develop prodrug activation chemistry employing minimal bioactivation steps to unmask multiple negative charges, within parasites. We will implement this strategy to dramatically enhance the antimalarial properties of FPPS-targeting zoledronate (Aim 1) and linear diphosphates targeting IspG (Aim 2). These studies will provide a foundation for the transformation of highly polar, potent inhibitors of isoprenoid biosynthesis into useful therapeutic agents for the treatment of infectious diseases.","6D"
2013,8416423,"5 K25 AI087968-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the proposed Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Award (K25) is to provide a period of mentored didactic and research training that will allow Dr. Krishanu Ray with his physics background to make a career transition into an independent biomedical researcher. The immediate goal is for Dr. Ray to expand his current research program in applying advanced fluorescence spectroscopy techniques to interrogate virus-host interactions in early stages of HIV infection. Specifically, Dr. Ray will employ novel fluorescence based approaches not previously described for viral entry process. The four-year training plan involves a structured curriculum of coursework and seminars focusing on HIV related research. This program will be heavily weighted toward gaining expertise regarding the HIV biology, particularly using optical imaging and spectroscopy based approaches to HIV research under the mentorship of two exceptional scientists, Dr. Joseph R. Lakowicz and Dr. Anthony L. DeVico at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSM). Because of Dr. Ray's location in the Center for Fluorescence Spectroscopy (CFS) and adjacent to the Institute of Human Virology (IHV) at the UMSM, it is possible to study the biophysical properties of HIV proteins and neutralizing antibody binding against HIV-1 envelope. The long-term goal is for Dr. Ray to acquire advanced biomedical research skills and knowledge that complement his skills as a spectroscopist. The ultimate goal is for him to develop into an independent, interdisciplinary biomedical researcher. This K25 award will enable Dr. Ray to take advantage of the outstanding resources available at CFS and IHV and expand his expertise and experience in this unique multidisciplinary setting. Dr. Ray will develop methods applying fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and single molecule detection (SMD) to directly probe the nature of HIV-1 envelope interactions with cell surface receptors and/or anti-envelope antibodies at the molecular level. It is hypothesized that a detailed understanding of the conformational dynamics that impact the HIV envelope before and during receptor engagement will explain the observed susceptibility to various inhibitors. Accordingly, Dr. Ray will focus on the following aims: 1) To develop methods for examining HIV-1 gp120-CD4 interactions at the single molecule level. 2) To characterize HIV-1 Env trimer conformational dynamics using single molecule spectroscopy. 3) To compare the binding of human monoclonal antibodies with different neutralizing potencies to HIV-1 envelope trimers by FCS and SMD. Successful completion of the Aims will provide new quantitative approaches at the individual molecular level towards understanding early steps in viral entry. This program will provide an excellent milieu in which the applicant - under close mentorship - can become deeply involved in applying advanced fluorescence spectroscopic and imaging approaches to HIV research. Mentorship will be geared more toward biological issues to provide a well-rounded portfolio as the candidate progresses toward independence in biomedical spectroscopic and imaging research. Human-immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been the subject of intensive research. The majority of antiretroviral drugs acts at a post-infection step and cannot cure HIV-1 infection. Consequently, there is a continued emphasis on developing either drugs or vaccines that block pre-entry events by targeting the HIV-1 surface trimers which enable binding to cell surface coreceptors. In this application, the nature of HIV-1 envelope interactions with cell surface receptors and/or anti-envelope antibodies will be determined at the single molecule level. This novel application of single molecule fluorescence based approaches is expected to provide unique information relevant to vaccine and drug development.","2B"
2013,8416635,"1 R01 DA034619-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central goal of this study is to examine physiological and emotional reactivity to social and gay- related stressors among sexual minority girls (SMGs; girls who report same-sex attraction, same-sex sexual behavior, and/or a bisexual or lesbian identity), and their prospective associations with substance use and abuse. Minority Stress Theory (MST; Meyer, 2003) asserts that discrimination, violence, and victimization are the primary driving mechanisms of substance use and other mental health disparities among SMGs. Several recent studies published by the proposed PI support this hypothesis. Meta-analysis results showed that compared with heterosexual girls, SMGs were 400% more likely to have used drugs and alcohol (Marshal et al 2008), and trajectory analyses show that this disparity is likely to increase as SMGs transition to young adulthood (Marshal et al 2009, 2012). Two other studies showed that compared with heterosexual girls, SMGs were almost 300% more likely to experience suicidality and over 300% more likely to report being assaulted at school (Friedman, Marshal, et al., 2011; Marshal et al, 2011). This study will recruit  120 adolescent girls ages 14-18 (50% SMGs, 50% African-American) to address the proposed aims. We are proposing a modified minority stress model, asserting that physiological and emotional stress reactivity are important components of the minority stress process, and mediators of the pathway to substance use and other mental health outcomes among SMGs. Our specific aims are to: (1) use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to document the daily social and gay-related stressors examine the  real time  links between these stressors and substance use, depression, and HIV risk behavior; (2) determine whether SMGs exhibit altered physiological and subjective responses to lab-based social and gay-related stress tasks; and (3) determine whether chronic stress exposure and biomarkers of stress reactivity predict long-term substance use, HIV risk behaviors, and other mental health outcomes. This will be the first study to assess, document, and describe stress reactivity processes among SMGs using lab-based and ecologically valid EMA methodologies. There are no empirically supported substance use interventions for sexual minority youth. Results from this study will accelerate progress towards the development of much needed prevention and intervention programs for SMGs at risk.","5B"
2013,8416935,"5 R01 AI095686-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose an innovative structural biology approach to stimulate pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine and drug development using integrated information from X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron tomography to develop a detailed molecular topography of the sporozoite surface. This work will provide a three-dimensional map of the native arrangement of two of the most critical surface proteins, (CSP) and thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP), and their most potent epitopes on the sporozoite surface. This work will also be of significance for providing insights into the structural mechanisms of parasite motility, cell invasion, and immune evasion. With the long term goal of stimulating rational malaria vaccine development and structure-based drug design, we have three specific aims. 1. We propose that CSP packs in a specific way to form the sporozoite sheath. CSP contains N-terminal, repeat, and thrombospondin type I repeat (TSR) domains. We will solve the crystal structure of the TSR domain of CSP, which differs significantly from the TSR domain in other proteins, in several different lattices. We hypothesize that we will find crystal lattices that mimic packing of the CSP TSR domain on the sporozoite surface. We will interpret the structure, including the presence of a putative 1-helix, in terms of its function in supporting stable, yet flexible, interactions between CSP molecules on the sporozoite surface. 2. We will solve the crystal structure of the tandem von Willebrand factor A (VWA) and TSR domains in TRAP. We wish to understand how ligand binding to TRAP mediates gliding motility and cell invasion. Structures will test the hypothesis that the VWA and TSR domains interact with one another in a manner conducive to conformational change transmitted by tensile force between the VWA domain and the cytoplasmic domain. 3. We will apply cryoelectron tomography to define ultrastructural details of the sporozoite surface. We expect to see three sheath layers corresponding to the N-terminal, repeat, and TSR domains, that differ in electron density and in packing. We expect to be able to use subtomogram averaging to analyze packing in the most membrane-proximal layer, and to compare this packing to that of the TSR domain in crystal lattices. We may also see islands of other molecules such as TRAP in a sea of CSP. Through complementary use of crystallography and cryolectron tomography and microscopy we plan to construct a model of the sporozoite sheath. These findings should provide important insights into how epitopes are shielded or exposed in the sheath at different times in the infection process, and how apicomplexans shield themselves from the immune system.","6D"
2013,8416938,"5 R21 AI098142-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The report of a single patient from Berlin who may be cured of his HIV disease almost 4 years after allogeneic stem cell transplant from a ?32 CCR5 donor has raised renewed excitement of the prospects for HIV gene therapy. One of the most promising vectors for doing so is based upon HIV, but current production methods are laborious and difficult to scale-up for possible clinical use. Here we propose the use of helper-dependent adenovirus or HDAd as a way to easily make HIV vector supernatants of high titer and quantity.  In preliminary data we have made a single HDAd encoding all the HIV cis and trans components as a second generation vector. When introduced into 293 cells at high MOI resultant HIV titers were close to 108 IU/ml, 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than conventional multiplasmid transfection production methods. We were able to scale up production using a cell factory, and HIV vector was generated over several days.  In this two-year proposal we now seek to extend this method to a third generation HIV vector. To do so, starting with an HDAd that already encodes VSV G, we will first incorporate an HIV packaging vector (PV) in several different sites and orientations. Once that testing is complete and the 1-2 best amplified HDAds are shown to be functional, an HIV transfer vector (TV) that encodes eGFP will be added, constructing up to a dozen HDAds that also have HIV-TV. After plasmid testing, the best 3-4 will be amplified, including one with all three HIV components. To produce HIV, 293-based cell lines will be transduced at increasing MOIs with the HDAds, supernatant harvested, and titered for HIV. HIV made from HDAd will be compared to that made using plasmid transfection in terms of pg CA per IU, genomic RNA content per IU, contamination with helper adenovirus, and ability to transduce non-dividing cells, including macrophages. Scalability will be shown using 3 l spinner flasks of suspension 293 cells. Finally, a TV encoding an anti-CCR5 shRNA will be incorporated into the HDAd and shown to be functional in transducing primary T cells and macrophages and protecting against M-tropic HIV challenge subsequently. At the end of the two year funding period we hope to have shown that it is possible to produce a fully functional, third generation VSV G-pseudotyped HIV vector using HDAd, of equal or greater titer compared to conventional plasmid transfection methods, which should have implications for the clinical use of these vectors for a wide range of congenital and acquired diseases, not merely HIV.","6A"
2013,8416943,"5 R37 AI030861-18","In the next 5-year phase of this R37 grant, we will continue our investigations in 2 of the three aims originally proposed. The third Aim, is a new aim and outgrowth of the current trends In HIV research of Investigating the role of host factors in specific viral functions. In Aim 1, we will continue the wori< on the RT determinants of dNTP selection and expand into determinants of mispair extension fidelity. We will further expand from our  novel observation that the K65 residue plays a critical role in forcing the insertion of incorrect basepairs due to the interaction between the lysine side chain and the y phosphate of incoming dNTP. We will use two novel ways of improving the fidelity of HIV-1 RT variants in which we will either use dNTP analogs that do  not have a negative charge on the y phosphate or remove the positive charge on the amino acid side chain by using unnatural amino acid residues. We believe that these two methods afford powerful means of testing the pivotal importance of this interaction to HIV-1 RT accuracy. We have also made a novel observation that certain amino acid substitutions and certain sequences in template-primer dnve the RT molecule to an unproductive, -2 position with respect to the templating base position. We will further explore and delineate the various conditions that facilitate a higher fidelity by displacing RT. In Aim 2, we will continue our previous work on RT-IN complexes by co-crystallizing HIV-1 RT-IN complexes in collaboration with Dr. Steve Almo.  When the structural information becomes available, we can carry out site-directed mutagenesis to disrupt residues in the interaction interface and carry out genetic protein-protein interaction assays and virological assays to determine the significance of the interaction. In Aim 3, we will Investigate the role of host factors in HIV reverse transcription. We will examine the genes Implicated in reverse trancription by shRNA screens by  Konig et al. The specific role of selected genes in reverse transcription will be confirmed by eliminating possible effects on entry and/or uncoating. First, we will develop an interactome of each hit via co-1.P. from both infected and uninfected cells to understand the pathways involved. Second, we will silence other members of the complexes thus identified for role in reverse transcription. Third, we will test whether the silencing of the 'hit's or their interacting partners will affect only HIV or also the related lenti- and retroviruses including SIVcpz, SIVmac, HIV-2, MuLV and RSV - to understand the wider significance of the proteins thus  identified to retroviruses.","2B"
2013,8416955,"5 R01 AI093635-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An effective blood stage Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine would be of immense global health benefit, particularly for infants and young children who suffer the greatest burden of malaria morbidity and mortality. We propose to use novel molecular epidemiological and structural vaccinology approaches to understand the human immune response to and the resulting antigenic diversity of apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1), a leading malaria vaccine candidate antigen. AMA1 is highly polymorphic; antigenic variation is likely a parasite immune escape mechanism that allows repeated infection with different variants in the face of natural immunity. We recently completed the first Phase 2 clinical trial of a monovalent AMA1- based malaria vaccine in children in Mali, West Africa. The vaccine had limited overall efficacy but good allele-specific efficacy against clinical malaria caused by parasites with AMA1 homologous to the vaccine strain with respect to immunologically relevant polymorphisms in AMA1. Molecular epidemiological and animal studies suggest that some regions of the AMA1 molecule represent  immunogenicity hot spots,  i.e. residues within these regions are critical to development of strain-specific protective immunity. The combined results of these clinical and laboratory studies suggest that the vast diversity of AMA1 alleles may be consolidated into a smaller number of subgroups, thereby reducing the number of variants that would have to be included to achieve a broadly cross-protective AMA1 vaccine. The proposed translational research project will employ novel molecular epidemiological approaches that we have developed, as well as a novel autotransporter protein expression system, to analyze patient serum samples collected in prospective longitudinal studies in a malaria endemic area, with the aim of identifying cross-reactive and cross-protective AMA1 epitopes.","1B"
2013,8416956,"5 R01 AI096882-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is characterized by stable lifelong viremia and a substantially increased risk of serious progressive liver disease. HCV persists in part because T cell immunity fails. Studies in adults have shown that cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are functionally exhausted or target viral epitopes that have mutated to escape recognition. Loss of CD4+ T helper cell activity is a hallmark of chronic hepatitis C but mechanisms that silence this critical immune response have not been identified. Chronic HCV infection appears to be modified by pregnancy. Viremia increases during pregnancy and then decreases, often by several logs, after childbirth. Our central hypothesis is that cellular immunit to HCV is fully restored, at least transiently, in the postpartum period. Two Specific Aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 is to compare HCV-specific cellular immunity and underlying immunoregulatory changes in women with and without a substantial drop in viremia in the postpartum period. Specifically we will test the hypothesis that viral control after childbirth is associated with a shift of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells from an exhausted to an effector state, with acquisition of multiple effector functions, susceptibility to signals from survival cytokines, and decreased predisposition to apoptosis. Further, we anticipate that declining viremia after delivery will be associated with changes in plasma cytokines and other pregnancy-related immunoregulatory molecules that promote Th1/Tc1 immunity. Specific Aim 2 is to determine the influence of pregnancy and delivery on evolution of HCV genomes and T-cell repertoire. We predict that CD8+ T cell immunity is relaxed during pregnancy, so that escape mutations in some class I epitopes revert to a sequence that is more fit for HCV replication. Postpartum resurgence of CD8+ T-cell immunity is expected to cause emergence (or re-emergence) of escape mutations in class I epitopes and include new T-cell clonotypes. Spontaneous recovery of T cell immunity that restricts HCV replication would represent a significant departure from the typical pattern of chronic infection described in men and non-pregnant women. We believe that understanding the mechanism(s) of spontaneous HCV control after childbirth is relevant to human health. For instance, it would provide insight into strategies to cure infection during a unique window of low virus replication in the mothers. The studies should also provide information on the relationship between replicative fitness and patterns of escape mutation in viruses that emerge late in pregnancy and are potentially transmissible to HLA semi-matched infants. More generally, the studies should provide a substantially new direction for unraveling the molecular basis of T cell dysfunction and approaches to immunomodulation in chronic hepatitis C and other chronic viral infections.","2D"
2013,8416991,"5 R01 MH085602-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective is to characterize mechanisms by which a host-derived protein called PINCH promotes neuronal fitness in response HIV infection of the CNS with the overall goal to understand PINCH's role in neurons exposed to viral and inflammatory factors. Synaptodendrtic injury correlates closely with the presence and severity of cognitive impairment in HIV patients. Since synaptodendritic damage in HIV infection of the brain is partially reversible and can occur in the absence of significant neuronal loss, information gained from these studies will enhance our ability to improve therapies to treat HIV infection of the brain and alleviate neurological complications observed in many HIV patients. In the brains of HIV infected individuals, PINCH is expressed exclusively by neurons showing signs of synaptodendritic damage. PINCH is an adapter protein that mediates bidirectional signal transduction between the extracellular matrix and intracellular networking pathways via interactions with integrin linked kinase (ILK) and Nck2. Thus, our overall hypothesis is that in response to disruptions in neuronal signaling caused by HIV infection of the CNS, PINCH protein is stabilized by sumoylation to promote proper interactions with ILK and Nck2. We propose two AIMS that investigate in vitro I) mechanisms by which PINCH expression is regulated, and II) the biological consequences of PINCH expression on neurons exposed to viral protein and host inflammatory factors produced during HIV infection of the CNS. Primary neurons treated with TNF-a or Tat to mimic some aspects of HIV infection of the brain will be assessed for PINCH expression via qRT-PCR, and Northern and Western analyses, and by siRNA knockdown. Sumoylation of PINCH will be assessed by reciprocal IP and Western analyses after exposure to TNFa and/or Tat. We further hypothesize that disruptions in PINCH's normal communication with ILK and Nck2 may diminish neuronal recovery. Neurons exposed to TNFa and/or Tat will be assessed for ILK and Nck2 expression and functional interactions with PINCH. To address biological consequences of PINCH in the context of HIV infection of the CNS, site-directed mutagenesis, PINCH protein accumulation and MALDI-TOF analyses will be used. Expanded studies of HIV patients' brains with MCMD, HIVE, dementia and importantly HAND in the absence of HIVE as well as HIV patients who died without CNS complications will be analyzed via laser capture microdissection of neurons and MALDI-TOF analyses will also be conducted.","2G"
2013,8416993,"5 K08 AI089242-05","The primary investigator is an MD/PhD trained infectious diseases physician with an interest in understanding enzymes that generate diversity in host-pathogen interactions. In the proposed work, the PI aims to bring his prior experience in enzyme mechanisms and develop new training through virologic experiments and immunologic studies. A remarkable group of enzymes, the polynucleotide cytidine deaminases of the AID/APOBEC family, play both constructive and destructive roles in struggle against HIV. On one hand, deamination by the family member APOBEC3G interferes with the integrity of the pathogen genome. In turn, HIV has evolved the lentiviral protein Vif as an evasive means to counteract human APOBEC3G. Infection with HIV is also associated with immune activation, which can result in increased expression of a B-cell specific deaminase family member, AID. AID physiologically serves as the chief catalyst governing antibody diversity through the introduction of targeted uracil lesions in antibody variable genes or switch regions which ultimately result in higher affinity antibodies of altered isotype. Aberrant regulation and expression of AID has increasingly been associated with Non-Hodgkins lymphoma, the leading AIDS-defining malignancy in HIV infected patients. Despite the importance of these cytidine deaminases, little is know about the nature of their interaction with their nucleic acid targets. This proposal addresses the hypothesis that the molecular interactions that lead to catalysis and binding of nucleic acids are critical determinants of their proper physiologic function. The studies aim to decipher and perturb these molecular interactions. Initially, structure-based hypotheses will be used to localize the protein determinants of sequence preference and resolve the mode of binding to the nucleic acid backbone. By utilizing novel loop graft mutant enzymes with altered sequence preference, the impact of perturbed sequence specificity on retroviral restriction (APOBEC3G) or antibody diversity and chromosomal translocations (AID) will be explored. To understand catalysis by AID/APOBEC enzymes, nucleoside analogs will be introduced into oligonucleotides via chemical or chemoenzymatic methods and are used to characterize the kinetics of deamination and the inhibition of pro-oncogenic AID activity. Taken together, a full characterization of the AID/APOBEC-nucleic acid complex ¿ binding and catalysis ¿ will provide a molecular basis for the action of this important enzyme family in vitro and in vivo. Through mentored training, the PI will develop the broad based research skills necessary to examine biological and biochemical aspects of diversity generation in host-pathogen interactions upon an ultimate transition to independence.","2B"
2013,8416999,"5 R01 MH081772-06","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research focuses upon events in the central nervous system (CNS) during the earliest weeks and months after initial acquisition of HIV infection, collectively defined as primary HIV infection (PHI). HIV enters the CNS in the earliest stages of infection, and the CNS is a site of persistent viral infection throughout the chronic stages of disease. The underlying hypothesis of this proposal is that initial viral neuroinvasion is important in the neuropathogenesis of HIV, leading to the foundation of persistent and compartmentalized CNS infection, and initiating the process of brain injury. The investigators will longitudinally study 75 subjects presenting during PHI to study the course of host immune and neurological responses and features of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) HIV quasispecies beginning during this period. The first aim is to understand the relationship between viral burden, early host inflammation, and tissue injury in the CNS, through measurement of CSF markers of inflammation, immune response, and neuronal injury, cerebral metabolites by high-field (4 Tesla) magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and neuropsychological testing. The second aim is to investigate the establishment of compartmentalized CNS infection through use of the heteroduplex tracking assay to detect HIV quasispecies sequence differences between and within CSF and plasma, and through measurement of viral replicative capacity and coreceptor utilization to define the character of early HIV species in each compartment. The final aim is to describe the effect of antiretroviral therapy initiated during PHI on the course of CNS inflammation and neurological responses. This study establishes a cohort for extended follow-up and a repository of banked longitudinal samples for future studies. Our proposed approach will provide crucial information about the clinical importance of early HIV in the nervous system; if immunoactivation-mediated brain injury or the establishment of compartmentalized CNS infection occurs during PHI, early treatment with immune- modulating or antiretroviral medications may provide previously unrecognized long-term neuroprotection. Similarly, detection of beneficial effects of treatment on the CNS during PHI has the potential to profoundly influence treatment strategies in early HIV. The overall goal of this proposal is to ameliorate or prevent HIV-related CNS damage through improved understanding of the early effects and treatment of HIV in the nervous system. Central nervous system (CNS) impairment remains a major complication of HIV-1 infection, and has the potential to affect at least 20% of the 40 million people worldwide who are living with HIV-1. Clarification of the time course of establishment of CNS infection and neurological injury will contribute to an understanding of the significance of the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection in the neuropathogenesis of AIDS. In addition, revealing the early effects of antiretroviral treatment in the CNS may provide a new rationale for initiating antiretroviral therapy in early HIV-1 infection.","2G"

Stage 1 pilot testing indicated the intervention could be easily learned and implemented with fidelity. The sample of 30 MA dependent individuals over 9 weeks showed large reductions in MA use, good retention and consistent attendance. The tailored treatment approach draws upon our previous conceptual papers on MI as well as our experience with a variety of MI protocols, including two Clinical Trials Network (CTN) studies of MI. An innovative feature of the  Higher Dose Motivational Enhancement Therapy  manual is that it comprehensively addresses the issues of clients who have achieved sustained sobriety as well as those still using substances. Thus, it is designed to facilitate treatment entry and engagement as well as maintenance of the gains made in treatment. We posit that a more intensive MI model is necessary to address MA dependent individuals because they frequently present more serious problems than individuals with other substance dependencies and are more prone to lose the gains they make in treatment. MA dependent clients (N=220) will be recruited from New Leaf outpatient treatment in Lafayette, California. This site has a long history of conducting research, including participation in a multi-site study assessing treatment outcome of MA dependence. Study participants will be randomly assigned to 1) a single session of Motivational Interviewing (MI) plus 8 hours of health/nutrition education, or 2) the intensive 9-session MI intervention. In addition to the study interventions, both groups will receive standard outpatient treatment services at New Leaf. Participants will be assessed weekly during the first 9 weeks of treatment for MA use. More extensive assessments will be conducted at treatment entry and 2-, 4-and 6-month follow-ups. Two therapists will be  crossed  and treat clients in both conditions. Primary outcome measures will be the Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) for MA use, MA urinalysis results, and retention in treatment. Secondary outcomes will include the ASI and the TLFB for alcohol and other drugs. Exploratory analyses will examine HIV risk behaviors, motivation, and service utilization. A mediation model will build upon MI research by Moyers et al. (2005) and our construct of  supportive confrontation  (Polcin, et al., 2006) by testing whether feedback enhanced with warnings about the potential harm of MA use facilitates the therapeutic alliance, and whether this in turn facilitates better outcome. The significance of the study is highlighted by a recent meta-analysis finding higher doses of MI were associated with better outcomes (Burke et al., 2003). Conversely, several recent studies of standard single session MI with drug dependent clients questioned its effectiveness. Clients with MA dependence are good candidates for a more intensive dose of MI because of their severe medical and psychosocial problems. Thus, it is time to test this promising intervention as a useful extension of standard MI for clients with MA dependence.","5A"

Clinical studies have shown a correlation between cocaine use and risky sexual practices such as increased frequency, an increased number of partners, and unprotected sex. These sexual practices have been linked to adverse health consequences including high prevalence rates for sexually-transmitted diseases. Controlled preclinical studies that utilize animal models have demonstrated that prior repeated exposure to cocaine enhances sexual motivation and behavior. However, no parametric or systematic studies further investigating the basic mechanisms underlying this relationship have been conducted. The goal of the proposed experiments is to utilize an animal model whose sexual behavior system has been well-studied, Japanese quail. In addition to the benefits of using quail to study sexual behavior, the use of a visually-oriented species in studying drug effects may be of additional relevance to studying human drug addiction. We currently have preliminary evidence in male Japanese quail that preexposure to cocaine enhances sexual motivation. This finding ties in well with clinical observations that indicate that cocaine use in humans may increase sexual motivation, thereby increasing the likelihood of the occurrence of high-risk sexual behavior. The overall working hypothesis of this proposal is that the magnitude of the sexual response depends on several cocaine preexposure parameters including dose, amount of exposure, time between exposures, and the withdrawal period before sexual behavior testing. Additionally, we hypothesize that cocaine preexposure increases the resistance to extinction (harder to eliminate) and facilitates the reacquisition of a sexual response that has been extinguished. The proposed research has the potential to contribute to our understanding of cocaine preexposure effects on sexual motivation using a visually-oriented animal model. For example, in males, sexual motivation may be enhanced by prior cocaine exposure. Such an enhancement might translate in humans as high risk or compulsive sexual behaviors such as increased frequency of sexual activity, sex with multiple partners, and unprotected sex. These risky sexual behaviors have been linked with considerable health consequences, such as the transmission of HIV and hepatitis C. The goal of the proposed project is to contribute to understanding underlying mechanisms of cocaine's effects on sexual motivation.","5B"
2013,8417014,"5 R37 DA007304-22","The loss of synaptic connections correlates with cognitive decline in many neurodegenerative disorders, including HIV-1 associated dementia (HAD). An assay was developed to image intact postsynaptic densities (PSDs) based on detection of clusters of the scaffolding protein PSD95 fused to green fluorescent protein (PSD95-GFP). In hippocampal neurons grown in primary culture, PSD95-GFP puncta were lost following exposure to factors released by HIV-1 infected cells. PSD loss was reversible. Cannabinoids, drugs given to AIDS patients clinically and widely used illicitly, modulate synapse loss. Three specific aims examine the effects of cannabinoids on the loss and recovery of synapses following exposure to HIV-1 proteins. 1) The hypothesis that neurotoxin-induced synapse loss is a mechanism to reduce excessive glutamatergic stimulation will be tested. These studies will delineate the signaling pathways that lead to synapse loss and cell death providing a foundation from which to study how drugs of abuse affect the balance between synaptic function and neuronal survival. 2) The hypotheses that recovery from synapse loss requires changes in NMDA receptor function and is guided by the location of pre-existing presynaptic terminals will be tested. By determining the mechanisms that initiate and direct the recovery of synapses, these studies will identify sites where cannabinoids might affect the ability of neurons to integrate back into the synaptic network. 3) The effects of acute and chronic exposure to cannabinoids on synaptic changes induced by HIV-1 proteins will be determined. The hypothesis that the mechanism by which cannabinoids modulate synapses depends on the toxic stimulus and the duration of drug treatment will be tested. These studies will provide insight into the processes that underlie cognitive decline in HAD and will enable us to determine the influence of cannabinoids on the balance between network function and cell survival. This project will provide a foundation to guide the development of drugs to improve function in HAD patients and will identify sites where drugs of abuse might interact with the formation and loss of synapses.","2G"
2013,8417022,"5 R01 AI080129-06","ABSTRACT The Natural Killer (NK) cell is a rapid effector arm of the innate immune response. Active before T cell responses, NK cells play a critical role against HIV and are regulated by a network of surface regulatory molecules, key among them the polymorphic KIR (killer Ig-like receptor). We propose to map the genetic variation of KIR - a potent and polymorphic regulator of NK cells ligated by HLA Class I alleles - to disease markers and NK cell function in a cohort of recently HIV-infected adults. Our research may determine if the NK response can be modulated to confer a novel mode of protection against HIV.  Due to its complexity, only a fraction of KIR loci have been examined for disease or functional associations in HIV-1 infected persons. Studies on the role of KIR and HLA in HIV-1 disease have focused on the KIR3DS1/KIR3DL1 loci and its putative ligand, HLA Bw4Ile80 (a subset of Class I alleles), and have yielded contrasting results. Some studies have found evidence of an interaction conferring clinical protection, while others have observed no evidence for an interaction. Other KIR genes are largely unexplored in HIV disease. Hence, we have intriguing but incomplete information about the role of KIR and NK function in HIV.  To chart this complex system, we will employ a novel mass spectrometry-based DNA sequencing method to chart the entire KIR gene cluster and the HLA Class I A, B, and C loci to NK cell functional profile (NK IFN-g, CD107a in a 721.221 target cell system) and early disease markers in a large, longitudinal study of 1500 adults from a North American and Brazilian early HIV infection cohort. We aim (1) To describe the KIR gene cluster, and the HLA A, B and C loci in 1300 recently infected adults; (2) To chart KIR and HLA genetics to NK effector function in these 1300 adults and (3) To perform KIR/HLA genetics and NK functional assays in a group of 200 HIV-1 exposed uninfected adults. The HIV-exposed uninfected group will allow assessment of the role of KIR/HLA in protection against HIV-1 acquisition and effects of HIV-1 infection on NK function. Our Brazil cohort enables us to further examine KIR and HLA effects on untreated subtype B infection, as treatment is not initiated until a CD4+ count of 300 cells/ul.","2B"

Recently, a major role for cellular signaling pathways in modulating toxicity downstream of EFV metabolism has been reported in vitro using primary human hepatocytes. Increased oxidative stress and the upregulation of the proapoptotic protein BimEL (Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death extra long) have been demonstrated to be crucial in the stimulation of EFV-induced cell death, and NVP appears to modulate hepatocyte death via the same mechanism. The goal of this proposal is to determine the manner in which EFV and NVP upregulate BimEL, while also gaining a mechanistic understanding of the events downstream of BimEL that mediate the hepatocyte death. The aims are as follows: (1) Test whether genetic deficiency of proapoptotic BimEL results in protection against EFV- and NVP-mediated cell death in vivo: BimEL null mice will be used to determine whether the absence of BimEL renders mice resistant to hepatotoxicity stimulated by these compounds; RNA interference studies in hepatocytes will be used to determine the role of effector proteins, Bax and Bak, that are downstream of BimEL in modulating EFV- and NVP-induced hepatocyte death; siRNA and reporter gene assays will be used to define the mechanism by which EFV and NVP regulate the transcription of BimEL; (2) determine if proapoptotic pathways that are activated by antiretrovirals in primary human hepatocytes are also activated in macaques receiving antiretroviral therapy; (3) probe a role for alteration of the glutathione pathway in EFV- and NVP-induced hepatotoxicity; the effects of these compounds on the glutathione pathway will be examined using a mass spectrometry-based approach that will precisely quantitate the intermediates/products of this pathway; RNA interference will be used to define the role of enzymes in the glutathione pathway in EFV- and NVP-induced hepatotoxicity. It is expected that completion of the proposed studies will lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for the potential prevention and treatment of EFV- and NVP-mediated hepatotoxicity.","6A"

As well, we seek to explore critical initiation and transition events that shape risk trajectories within these populations. Our proposed study is nested within a larger program of research that includes five NIDA-funded longitudinal cohort studies of adult DU and FSW and street-involved youth in Vancouver, Canada. Thus, our approach offers a 'value-added' opportunity to employ and integrate multiple data collection and analytic techniques to identify the impacts of social, structural and physical features of sex work and drug use scenes on HIV outcomes, and will include ethnographic observational fieldwork, in- depth interviews, geo-spatial mapping techniques, and quantitative laboratory and survey data. Through this effort we will seek to advance methodological approaches to the study of HIV/AIDS among vulnerable populations, by piloting a novel ethno-spatial approach to elucidate the complex pathways to HIV risk and HIV treatment among DU and FSW. Further, we aim to create a platform for the ongoing ethno-spatial evaluation of future interventions targeting DU and FSW that can be replicated in other settings within North America. The city of Vancouver is an ideal setting for the proposed research. Like many cities in the US, Vancouver is home to established drug and sex work scenes, and has experienced a high burden of HIV infection among DU and FSW. Officials in Vancouver, like those in several US municipalities, are implementing a range of policies and interventions aimed at reducing the public health and public order impacts of drug use and sex work, including those involving policing, supportive housing, and modifications to the physical environment. A nascent body of evidence suggests that while these interventions can reduce public disorder, they often have unintended negative consequences for vulnerable populations, prompting calls for an integration of public health and public order initiatives. However, the impact of such interventions on HIV risk behavior, HIV incidence, and HIV treatment outcomes has not been fully elucidated. Likewise, the associated impacts on critical initiation and transitional events among DU and FSW that shape risk trajectories are not well understood. Globally, there is growing recognition of the need to identif how social, structural and physical environments affect the health of marginalized drug using populations, and how interventions can address these levels of influence. The evaluation of social and structural influences and the promotion of methodological diversity have been identified as high priorities within the Office of AIDS Research's Trans-NIH Plan for 2011. Accordingly, through the use of complementary and innovative mixed-methods research, we aim to address several urgent health challenges, which will inform the development of a range of policies and interventions in both Canada and the United States.","1A"
2013,8417613,"5 K23 AI078755-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Ethan Cowan is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. With a background in research on informed consent for clinical procedures, Dr. Cowan is now seeking to develop expertise in empirical research in bioethics. Dr. Cowan is planning to study the intersection of bioethics as it applies to the individual and the health of the public. Emergency Departments (EDs) are a unique environment for this type of research because they provide individual clinical care and serve as a  safety net  for the population by treating the uninsured and underserved making it difficult to separate clinical and public health practice. The proposed study examines the ethical implications of a new public health initiative, opt-out provider-initiated HIV testing (hereby referred to as opt-out testing) in the ED. A mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to explore ED patients' and providers' beliefs, attitudes and acceptability toward opt-out testing. Ethical aspects of opt-out HIV testing will be examined including, 1) the ability of patients to understand that they have the right to decline the HIV test and that testing will be performed unless they exercise that right, 2) patients' understanding of HIV pretest information prior to undergoing testing, and 3) the impact of language on the understanding of opt-out testing and HIV pretest information. The research will be conducted in the urban ED of the Jacobi Medical Center, serving over 70,000 adult patients annually and staffed by faculty experienced in conducting NIH clinical trials. Dr. Cowan's training plan includes formal coursework, direct mentoring, specialized seminars, and practical experience in project planning and execution. Courses have been selected from the sociomedical sciences curriculum of Columbia University and the ethics program at Union Graduate College. Headed by a world renowned ethicist, Dr. Ruth Macklin, a committee of experts in clinical research methods will serve as mentors for this project. The proposed research has direct impact on public health. The instruments developed in this study may be adapted for use in evaluating and monitoring the ethical aspects of national and international opt-out testing programs. Furthermore, if this study demonstrates that opt-out testing is acceptable and can be ethically implemented this will lend support for adoption of ED based opt-out testing programs on a national scale.","1C"
2013,8417643,"5 R01 AI098569-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The innate immune response alerts the host to infection before an adaptive immune response has a chance to develop. Viral nucleic acids introduced into cells or synthesized during infection trigger cytosolic sensors of innate immunity to produce antiviral cytokines, such as type I interferons (IFN). Some viruses evade immune sensing. The increase in viremia during acute stages of infection are associated with widespread activation of DCs and activation of IFN, although HIV infection of target cells such as T cells and macrophages does not induce intrinsic antiviral IFN responses. This application focuses on intracellular innate immunity in target cells and aims to understand how HIV avoids innate immune activation. Prior to work conducted by the Principal Investigator (PI), intracellular innate immune recognition of retroviruses especially HIV has been a key information gap in our existing knowledge regarding innate immune recognition of viruses. We recently discovered that the cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 suppressed the IFN response triggered by HIV DNA. In Trex1-/- mouse cells and human CD4+ T cells and macrophages in which TREX1 was inhibited by RNAi, HIV DNA accumulated in the cytosol and HIV infection induced IFN production that inhibited HIV replication and spreading. Our study suggested that cytosolic HIV DNA is a key pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that can be detected by innate immunity and activate IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and that HIV exploits host factors (such as TREX1) to subvert innate immune detection. We also provide extensive preliminary data that uncover a cytosolic DNA detection pathway involved in the recognition of HIV DNA, and a novel mechanism by which TREX1 inhibits IFN induction. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) To define the role(s) of an innate immune DNA sensing pathway in the recognition of cytosolic HIV DNA. 2) To characterize how TREX1 inhibits the innate immune response to HIV. 3) To characterize how the opposing dynamic between HIV innate immune detection and HIV innate immune evasion contributes to the establishment of infection by HIV. Our proposed study will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of how HIV subvert innate immune responses, and lay the foundation for harnessing intracellular innate immunity as a novel avenue of therapeutics.","2C"
2013,8417689,"5 R01 MH087233-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV CNS disease is characterized by activation of macrophages/microglia in the brain and production of proinflammatory cytokines and proapoptotic/neurotoxic mediators that leads to neuronal loss. While highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been successful in improving the quality of life for most HIV-infected individuals, there can be a surprising degree of ongoing neuroinflammation in the brains of patients on HAART. As a result, there still is a need to identify therapeutics that will control CNS inflammation. The immune status of the periphery is central to the development of HIV-associated neurological disease in the brain. Continued stimulation of the innate immune system characterized by ongoing production of IFNa and ¿ as well as IDO during HIV infection is thought to be responsible for increased activation and proliferation of T cells, loss of T cells and inhibition of T cell function, eventually leading to immune exhaustion. Minocycline is a safe and effective antibiotic that has potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities, inhibits HIV/SIV replication in macrophages and lymphocytes and ameliorates the severity of CNS inflammation and neurodegeneration in SIV-infected macaques. This occurs at least partly by reducing production of Type I IFNs and suppressing activation of lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages, thus reducing the number of cells that traffic to the brain. Interestingly, one of the major characteristics of natural hosts for SIV infection such as sooty mangabeys and African green monkeys, which can be infected but do not get AIDS, is that they have significantly fewer activated lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. Our hypothesis is that minocycline, by suppressing chronic, unregulated innate immune responses, thus reducing the activation and proliferation of lymphocytes, acts by pharmacologically converting the non-natural host's anti-viral immune responses to those of a natural host, thus preventing immune exhaustion and maintaining systemic immune function. This reduces trafficking of T cells and macrophages to the CNS, thus reducing the severity of CNS disease. Aim 1 of this application is to determine whether administration of minocycline to SIV-infected macaques beginning immediately after acute infection suppresses the chronic unregulated activation of innate and adaptive immune responses in both the periphery and the brain, reducing expression of Type I IFNs and IDO, the number of activated lymphocytes and macrophages and virus replication in the brain. Aim 2 is to determine whether treatment of animals with minocycline prior to infection with SIV normalizes innate immune responses to the virus and reduces or abrogates virus infection of the CNS. Aim 3 is to determine the extent to which the calcium binding, antioxidant or membrane association properties of minocycline contribute to its ability to suppress lymphocyte and macrophage activation and SIV replication.","2G"
2013,8417691,"5 R01 AI069000-08","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An estimated 170 million people worldwide and 4 million people in the United States are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The majorities of patients do not resolve the infection and develop chronic infections that often lead to end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current treatment is limited to a combination therapy of ribavirin and interferon 1. This therapy is expensive and ineffective in 50% of infected individuals. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify viral or cellular molecules that can be used as novel targets in antiviral therapy. It was discovered that HCV binds two molecules of a liver-specific microRNA, miR-122, resulting in a novel, unprecedented upregulation of the viral genome. Sequestration of miR-122 in HCV-infected cultured cells or in livers of infected chimpanzees leads to a dramatic loss of infectious virus without emergence of resistant virus. Therefore, the dependence of HCV on miR-122 presents an Achilles heel of the virus that can be explored for antiviral intervention. This application proposes to study the roles for miR-122 in the viral life cycle and in cholesterol biosynthesis using a novel class of antisense molecules, locked nucleic acids (LNAs) that can easily be delivered to the liver in animals where it sequesters miR-122 in an inactive small duplex RNA. In particular, the first aim will characterize the RNA-RNA interactions in the miR-122/HCV complex, using genetic and biochemical approaches. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that miR-122 protects the 5' end sequences of the HCV RNA from degradation by ribonucleases or RNA modification enzymes, or aids in the avoidance of activation of double-stranded RNA sensors such as the retinoic acid inducible gene I. These studies will be performed in specific and genome-wide siRNA-mediated gene knockdown experiments. Aim 3 proposes to examine roles for the known isoforms of miR-122 that contain extra 3' terminal adenosine or guanosine residues, on HCV RNA abundance. Deep sequencing analysis and gene knockdown of suspected nucleotidyl transferases will aid in this analysis. The final aim will characterize in detail the mechanism by which miR-122 regulates the expression of Insig1, the major negative regulator of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism in the liver. In particular, the miR-122-mediated down-regulation of a distinct polyadenylation/cleavage site in a specific Insig1 isoform mRNAs will be examined. Overall, this application will address fundamental aspects about the functions of miR-122 in the HCV life cycle and cholesterol metabolism. The outcomes from these studies will detail novel mechanisms of gene expression mediated by microRNAs in eukaryotic cells and will point to new venues for antiviral therapies.","2D"
2013,8417695,"5 R01 AI087917-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important cause of liver disease. Current therapies are inadequate. A cocktail of multiple drugs, each targeting an independent viral function offers the best chance for effective pharmacologic control. Our long-term objectives are to better understand the molecular virology of HCV, increase the repertoire of new targets that can be translated into novel drug classes for inclusion in future anti-HCV cocktails. We have identified and genetically validated two new targets within NS4B: an arginine-rich-like motif mediated RNA binding activity that is specific for the 3' terminus of the viral negative RNA strand (3'term(-)); and an amphipathic helix, termed 4BAH2, with a dramatic ability to promote lipid vesicle aggregation, an ideal candidate biochemical activity for creating the membranous web, the HCV replication platform. We then identified small molecule inhibitors of these two targets with significant anti-HCV activity: a first generation H1 antihistamine-clemizole-potently inhibits NS4B RNA binding and exhibits dramatic in vitro synergy with the HCV NS3 protease inhibitor SCH503034. Two distinct compounds-A2 and C4-were each found to be potent specific inhibitors of 4BAH2-mediated lipid vesicle aggregation. Finally, we recently developed a new method for rapidly mapping RNA secondary structure, affording new ways to study RNA elements such as the target of NS4B binding. Our overall hypothesis is that two different newly described functional activities within NS4B are each essential for mediating NS4B's role in HCV replication. Thus approaches designed to disrupt the function of these domains may be potentially used to inhibit HCV replication in patients. More specifically, we hypothesize: 1) clemizole's antiviral activity is distinct from its antihistamine activity; 2) the mechanism of action of A2 and C4 can be further validated by analysis of resistant mutants and derivatives of these compounds; 3) while A2 and C4 both target the same 4BAH2, they do so via distinct mechanisms, where one targets 4BAH2's interaction with membranes, and one targets 4BAH2's interaction with itself; 4) NS4B RNA binding inhibitors are broadly synergistic with NS3 protease inhibitors; 5) both NS4B RNA binding inhibitors and 4BAH2 inhibitors represent attractive potential new drug classes for future anti-HCV therapeutic cocktails designed to maximize efficacy and minimize resistance; 6) 4BAH2's lipid vesicle aggregating activity reflects a biochemical activity important for membranous web formation that is amenable to both genetic and pharmacologic disruption, and the specific amino acids critical for this activity can be identified by mutational analysis; 7) the secondary structure of the HCV 3'term(-) is altered upon interaction with NS4B or clemizole, or upon mutation to escape clemizole inhibition; 8) expression of wild-type and drug-resistant forms of NS4B can enable critically important 3D structure determinations. To test these hypotheses, we propose to further study these compounds' mechanism of action, determine their potential as critical components of future anti-HCV cocktails, and better understand the structure and function of these compounds' targets within NS4B and the HCV life cycle.","6D"

The burden of HCV infection worldwide is very large, with most of the personal and economic burden yet to come, as cirrhosis and cancer take years to develop. Approximately 170 million people are infected worldwide with HCV. Most infected individuals do not clear the disease, but develop chronic infections that often lead to end-stage liver disease. Current treatment is limited to co-treatment with ribavirin and interferon 1, a therapy that is expensive and ineffective in 50% of infected individuals. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify new and accessible viral and cellular targets for therapies against HCV. This application will study two important HCV RNA-protein interactions that regulate HCV gene amplification. A highly-structured RNA element is located in the viral 5' noncoding region that functions as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that can directly recruit 40S ribosomal subunits to the viral genome. Specifically, we will employ biochemical, NMR and single-molecule fluorescence approaches to explore the timing and control of subunit joining on IRES-initiated mRNAs. In addition, we will examine roles for eukaryotic initiation factors eIF5B and eIF2 in causing conformational changes in the ribosomal subunits. Using FRET and optical tweezer approaches, we will measure stabilities of IRES-ribosomal complexes and rearrangements of these complexes on mRNAs. Proposed long-range communication between 5' and 3' ends in HCV viral RNAs will be studied using NMR. Secondly, we will study the interaction of RNA helicase RIG-I with viral and host RNA ligands. Specifically, a cell-based crosslinking-immunoprecipitation (CLIP) assay will be employed to identify HCV and cellular RNA ligands for RIG-I. Using an infectious HCV cell-based system, we will determine whether RIG-I targets the viral RNA in replicating or translating RNA molecules. Using siRNA-mediated gene knock down, biochemical and cell-biological assays, we will characterize roles, 5' end modifications and localization of identified RIG-I ligands. Using biochemical assays, NMR and FRET analyses, biophysical and structural parameters for RIG-I ligand recognition and enzymatic kinetics that are activated by the RNAs will be examined and a structural framework for these activities will be established. Structural, dynamic and mechanistic views of HCV non-coding region structures, that modulate translation, and that of specific RNA ligands associated with RIG-I, that are part of innate immune responses, will be merged with approaches that probe function, and potential inhibition by therapeutics.","2D"

A vaccine is required to help limit spread of the disease. Most effective vaccines developed to date elicit neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). There have been at least two major roadblocks en route to developing a component that elicits NAbs to HCV. The first is the lack of a conventional neutralization assay because of an inability to culture HCV in vitro. This roadblock has recently been at least partly dismantled by the development of systems for culturing HCV, albeit currently with certain limitations. The second roadblock is the great sequence variation of HCV found in infected donors that suggests a vaccine should elicit NAbs effective against a wide variety of different viruses, i.e. the vaccine should elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. We propose a program to investigate the necessary conditions to induce a strong neutralizing antibody response against multiple HCV isolates and use the knowledge gained to design a NAb-inducing component of an HCV vaccine. We will systematically dissect NAb responses to HCV in natural infection, and isolate mAbs that are most potent and broad against neutralizing diverse isolates of HCV (Aim 1). These prototype mAbs will help us to identify neutralizing epitopes on HCV and we will explore the interaction between these epitopes and NAbs at the molecular level (Aim 2). We will apply knowledge gained from these molecular studies to the design of immunogens in order to produce NAb responses in animals (Aim 3).

First, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects 33 million individuals with roughly 3 million new infections per year. Our laboratory has recently developed a model for the overall architecture and secondary structure of the entire RNA genome for one HIV-1 virus. This work revealed numerous previously unrecognized, but evolutionarily conserved, RNA structures. Further refinement of complete HIV genome structures and identification of protein-RNA interactions in the genome hold significant promise for identifying novel targets and pathways for antiretroviral drug development. Second, viruses usurp the genetic instructions present in all living organisms. Structured RNA regulatory elements that we have discovered in the HIV-1 genome appear to influence splicing, protein translation, evasion of host cell defenses, and accessibility towards drug binding. The extraordinary density of information encoded in the HIV-1 RNA genome appears to represent a key component of the genetic code, one that we understand poorly at present. The proposed research program will therefore enhance our understanding of the fundamental principles that govern gene regulation in all of biology. Third, essentially all RNA molecules function in biology only after they fold into specific secondary (and tertiary) structures. SHAPE (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) technology, invented in the PI's laboratory, now makes it possible to analyze the local nucleotide environment at nearly every position for RNAs of arbitrary size and as bound by proteins. However, data analysis remains labor-intensive. We seek to streamline the data processing steps to make possible facile and comprehensive functional analyses of arbitrary intact large RNAs. In collaboration with experts in HIV biology and in bioinformatics, we will therefore tackle the following Aims: (1) Analyze the structures of the complete genomes of two additional HIV-1 related viruses, the simian immunodeficiency virus from chimpanzees (SIVcpz) and from the rhesus macaque (SIVmac). (2) Analyze the complete HIV-1 genome, as it exists inside authentic HIV-1 virions in both immature and mature particles. (3) Create a platform-independent, user-friendly software for fully automated analysis of high-throughput SHAPE information. All technology advances and HIV genome data sets will be made freely available to the biomedical science community.","2B"

Resistance to all traditional antimalarial drugs, and early signs of weakening effectiveness of artimesinin-based drugs in SE Asia, further emphasizes a need for basic and translational research to identify new interventions to treat and to avoid malaria. The P. falciparum and the P. vivax parasite are single cellular pathogens with multiple compartmentalized genomes: The nuclear genome, the mitochondrial genome, and the apicolplast genome. The last is a chloroplast-like relict plastid that is essential for parasite survival. The survival and development of the parasite, in all its stages, is dependent on continual management of smooth unwinding, replication, and ligations of DNA molecules. These functions rely on topoismerase enzymes, which are known to be important targets of antimicrobial chemotherapy. The development of malaria topoisomerase inhibitors has been hampered by an inability to express the proteins in functional form. The Rathod laboratory has argued and shown that toxicity of malaria proteins in functional form can limit the ability of traditional heterologous expression systems, such as E. coli, to support expression of functional protein. We have used a cell-free wheat germ translation system to successfully express a number of malaria proteins in functional for, including the first P. falciparum topoisomerase II. In this project application, we will express all P. falciparum and P. vivax candidate topoisomerase and DNA gyrase gene products, test their catalytic activity, purify them to homogeneity, and develop miniaturized efficient assays for High Throughput Screening. These studies will set the stage for direct screening of chemical libraries to ultimately yield small molecules to prevent and to treat malaria.","6D"

Project Encuentro consists of provision of social network HIV testing and Peer Network Interventions among crack users. Specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To measure the effectiveness of the multi-level community-based intervention with regard to increasing testing rates and decreasing sexual risk behavior among crack users; (2) To analyze the combined effects of the Peer Network and social network HIV testing components on increases in testing and reductions in sexual risk behavior among crack users; (3)To explore the community and organizational factors of successful or unsuccessful implementation (systems level analysis) of various components of the multi-level, community-based HIV prevention intervention. To accomplish these aims we will use a mixed qualitative, quantitative approach. In order to explore aims 1 and 2, we will conduct cross-sectional surveys with crack users residing, buying or using crack in each of the 4 community sites (n=300 per assessment) and measure HIV testing rates in MSPAS clinics before and after implementation of the social network HIV testing. Implementation of the intervention components will be rolled out consecutively, and we will administer multiple assessments (6 total, including 2 baselines) in order to assess trends in increasing effects of the intervention components over time. We will also carefully measure exposure to non-Encuentro HIV prevention interventions and information, to further rule out historical change unrelated to our intervention. To explore aim 3, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with community partners, and observations of trainings, community meetings and steering committee meetings. To examine fidelity and quality of intervention components, we also will collect observations of HIV testing, and sessions of the Peer Network Intervention with crack users. Data for Specific Aim 3 will be collected throughout the project. Results from key informant interviews and observations will be coded to reflect key systems factors related to successful implementation of intervention components in the four community sites. Coded barriers and facilitators will then be included as data in the cross-section surveys for each community, corresponding to the same time periods of intervention implementations and field observation or interviews.","5A"

This DIDARP will include two primary and one pilot research projects that will focus on mechanisms and factors that might enhance neurotoxicity associated with methamphetamine of HIV. We aim to enhance the capacity for drug abuse research at UH by creating this small translational research team. This group will take advantage and build on the expertise of the few but outstanding existing clinical drug abuse and HIV researchers and basic scientists. We aim to enable UH to develop a strong clinical and translational drug abuse research program. To complement these projects, we additionally propose training and career development activities that wil offer exciting opportunities for DIDARP investigators and others at UH through the Administrative and Training Core. The Faculty in the Core will provide guidance and mentorship for these junior faculty and graduate students, through infrastructure support, educational courses, seminars, and a dedicated DIDARP website, We have obtained institutional support for two additional graduate students for the program. We also have recruited 4 distinguished External Advisory Committee members with expertise related to the proposed research; each has enthusiastically agreed to provide their advice and letter of support for the development of this DIDARP at UH.","2G"
2013,8417731,"5 R01 DA029316-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in the health care system make it necessary to regularly update our knowledge of how services for drug use disorders are provided. It is particularly important in the current environment because of the recent passage of federal parity legislation which requires group health plans offering mental health/addiction services to cover these services in a comparable manner to medical/ surgical services, effective January 1, 2010 for most health plans. Building on two previous rounds of our health plan survey, we propose to (1) enhance the  core  third round planned for 2010 by adding specific questions on drug abuse treatment and an in-depth module on parity, and (2) conduct a follow-up survey in 2012 focused on health plan response after final parity regulations have been issued and the 2011 cost opt-out provision is finished. The specific aims are:    * Describe the provision of services for drug use disorders in private health plans in terms of administrative and clinical factors by enhancing a survey for benefit year 2010 to specifically focus on drug abuse services and analyze changes in health plans' provision of these services in the last decade by comparing to previous rounds of the survey in 1999 and 2003.    * Study health plans' specific responses to the implementation of federal parity legislation on January 1, 2010 with an in-depth analysis of changes that were specifically adopted because of parity, by enhancing the 2010 survey through a special module on parity.    *  Study health plans' further responses to federal parity legislation in benefit year 2012, following both the requirement that all plans opting out in 2011 participate in 2012 and the issuance of clarifying final regulations expected to go into effect in 2011.    * Model changes from benefit year 2010 to 2012 in health plans' implementation of parity, reflecting changes in response to parity regulations and the cost opt-out provision.    The proposed study of drug treatment services will combine the 1999, 2003, and the 2010 rounds and the 2012 parity follow-up of our nationally representative health plan survey in a prospective design that will allow us to track how the delivery of drug services evolves within the changing health care market. It will specifically focus on issues related to federal parity, particularly health plan response in light of regulations and cost opt- out provisions.","5B"
2013,8417733,"5 R01 DA029512-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study will examine the feasibility, acceptability, safety, effectiveness, and cost of an integrated care program for hepatitis C, addiction, and HIV prevention in active injection drug users (IDUs), in comparison with standard, separate treatment for each of these conditions. Hepatitis C is already the leading cause of liver failure and liver transplantation in the US, and the disease burden and health care costs are expected to continue to rise in coming years. IDUs constitute the core of the hepatitis C epidemic, with prevalence rates >70% in most studies. But although antiviral treatment can eradicate the infection in many patients, few studies have reported successful treatment of this infection in active illicit drug users, and they are rarely offered antiviral treatment. In collaboration with community-based organizations providing services to IDUs in the South Bronx and East Harlem, we developed a multidisciplinary, integrated-care program and found that we could effectively treat both hepatitis C and substance abuse in IDUs recruited from community-based settings who were actively using illicit drugs. The program provided primary care, hepatitis C specialty care, mental health services, and substance abuse treatment, using Case Managers and Multidisciplinary Case Conf- erences to coordinate and integrate services from multiple, geographically separate providers. By reducing illicit drug use and providing HIV risk reduction the program reduces high-risk injection and sexual HIV risk behavior as well. This model has the advantage of delivering integrated, multidisciplinary care primarily in community-based settings where drug users are comfortable receiving services. Moreover, because it integrates care from geographically separate providers it is replicable in the vast majority of settings where co- location of multidisciplinary services is not possible. NIH has identified research comparing integrated vs. separate treatment of substance abuse and comorbid conditions as high-priority Comparative Effectiveness Research. We hypothesize that for patients suffering from addiction and hepatitis C, an integrated approach to treating these conditions together will be more effective than fragmented approaches to each condition separately. The Specific Aims of this study are to assess: (1) the effectiveness of hepatitis C treatment, (2) the safety of hepatitis C treatment, (3) substance abuse treatment outcomes, and (4) reduction in HIV risk behaviors in a community-based sample of active IDUs randomized to receive integrated vs. separate care. Chronic hepatitis C is the number one cause of chronic liver disease and liver cancer in most of the Western world. An estimated one million active IDUs in the US have hepatitis C and no access to treatment. Without better models of care, many will require liver transplants or die. The hepatitis C epidemic threatens to overwhelm the fragile and fragmented healthcare infrastructure serving the indigent, precipitating a healthcare crisis of major proportions. Understanding how to engage active IDUs in treatment for substance abuse and hepatitis C will be critical to mitigating the extraordinary morbidity and mortality these epidemics will cause.","5A"

The most deadly form of the disease is caused by the opportunistic pathogen, Plasmodium falciparum. Significant efforts have been made to understand the process by which the parasite invades a host cell to establish infection, yet relatively little is known about the process by which the parasite mediates its release after replication has occurred. This process is essential for propagation of the pathogen and agents that block rupture are likely to be valuable for development as novel anti-malarial agents. This proposal outlines plans to use small molecules to study the functional roles of proteases that regulate the process of host cell rupture. Specifically, it describes the use of phenotypic screens using libraries of protease inhibitors to identify compounds that block the release of parasites from host red blood cells. Screening hits will be used to identify protease targets and to dissect the details of their regulation of host cell rupture. Finally, lead compounds will be applied to mouse models of malaria to validate multiple proteases as drug targets for novel anti-malarial therapies.","2D"
2013,8417745,"5 R01 AI077390-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hypothesis for this proposal is as follows:  a pH responsive novel nano-lipid complex delivery system targeted to lymphoid tissues and HIV host cells will greatly improve cell and tissue selectivity, and thus overcome drug insufficiency of anti-HIV drugs in lymphoid tissues, leading to maximum viral suppression.  We will test this hypothesis with a well-established HIV-infected primate model to determine the effects of this novel drug delivery strategy targeted to lymphoid tissue and cells on disease progression. To do so, we will (in aim 1) design pH-responsive lipid-nanoparticles composed of anti-HIV drug combination for enhanced activity in virus host cells. The second aim is designed to compare the most potent anti-HIV nanoparticles containing inhibitors of HIV protease and reverse transcriptase with respect to target tissue and cell selectivity and resident time. The data collected from time-course and dose-dependent pharmacokinetic and tissue localization studies will be used to define a safe and effective dosing schedule for the proof-of-principle study in HIV-infected primates. Finally, we will evaluate the impact of the optimized, pH-responsive anti-HIV nanoparticles on HIV infection and disease progression. The proposed targeted novel drug delivery strategy will accelerate clearance of residual virus in lymphoid tissues and cells, which received limited exposure to orally administered drugs. A primate model is used to probe questions that could not be addressed in humans. The results obtained from these studies hold promise for making a profound advance in anti-HIV drug therapy and providing a proof-of-principle for  first-in-human  clinical testing. Successful completion of this study will have significant impact on treatment paradigms and outcome of HIV infections. With an established investigative team, we could proceed with first-in-human studies when a positive outcome is achieved.","6A"
2013,8417751,"5 R01 AI087658-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis is a major public health problem. One-third of the population of the world is estimated to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the etiological agent causing tuberculosis (TB), and active disease kills nearly 2 million individuals worldwide every year. Successions of treatments of TB have quickly become ineffective as the agent rapidly becomes resistant. However, strikingly, only 10% of infected individuals develop the disease. In other words, while Mtb quickly develops resistance to new drugs, roughly 90% of individuals are naturally resistant to infection (when not co-infected by agents, which compromise the immune system, such as HIV). Several lines of evidence indicate that genetic factors contribute to inter-individual differences in susceptibility to TB, including the observation that monozygotic twins have considerably higher concordance rates for tuberculosis morbidity than do dizygotic twins. In addition, multiple rare single-gene mutations with high penetrance have also been linked with susceptibility to mycobacteria. However, although genetic studies of TB have identified important pathways involved in protective immunity, very little is known about the underlying genetic determinants or mechanisms contributing for differences in susceptibility at the population level. Here, we propose to use a combination of empirical and statistical approaches to identify genes and regulatory pathways that contribute to inter-individual and inter-population variability in the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Specifically, we will study inter- individual variation in the immune transcriptional response of dendritic cells following infection with Mtb, and map the genetic loci that are associated with such variation (eQTLs). To our knowledge, this will be the first genome-wide study of variation in molecular quantitative traits and associated genetic markers that underlie inter-individual variation in immune response to infection with Mtb, and ultimately variation in susceptibility to TB.","2D"
2013,8417763,"5 R01 DK055679-15","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The gastrointestinal epithelium functions as a dynamic permeability barrier that separates luminal contents from underlying tissue compartments and is vital in maintaining mucosal homeostasis. Pathologic processes such as inflammatory bowel disease and ischemia induce epithelial injury and mucosal wounds that result in barrier disruption. In response to injury, intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) migrate as a cohesive sheet to rapidly cover denuded surfaces, close wounds and re-establish the critical epithelia barrier in a process termed restitution. Epithelial cell migration is critically dependent on actin cytoskeletal restructuring, directional polarization of cells into the wound and dynamic focal cell-matrix adhesion turnover. The long term goals of this proposal are to define mechanisms by which the intestinal epithelium migrates in response to injury and inflammation to efficiently reseal mucosal barrier defects. We recently determined that a multifunctional membrane associated and actin binding protein, Annexin 2 (AnxA2) and a secreted regulator of Wnt signaling, Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1), play critical roles in controlling IEC migration and restitution. Thus our aims in this proposal are to define the mechanisms by which AnxA2 and Dkk-1 regulate IEC motility and wound closure. These studies will not only advance our understanding of AnxA2 and Dkk-1 function in the intestine, but will also aid in the development of new therapeutic strategies aimed at facilitating mucosal barrier recovery.","2G"

PROJECT SUMMARY (See instmctlons): The long-term objective of this MERIT renewal remains to design, synthesize, characterize and evaluate novel polymeric drug nanocarriers that enhance anti-AIDS drug bioefficacy by improving delivery, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Our strategy utilizes polymeric bioconjugate-type nanocarriers comprising a novel peptide-polymer scaffold with component agents that: (a) target HIV-infected cells through specific cell-surface receptors, (b) control cellular and body disposition & retention, (c) alter cell uptake pathways, and (d) selectively release drug inside cells. Specific aims: (1) To evaluate nanocarriers for macrophage targeting and anti-HIV activity using multiplex affinity ligands for the formyl peptide receptor, mannose receptor, CCR5 and CXCR4 using protease inhibitors in cells chronically infected with HIV-1; (2) To determine the effect of peptide-polymer scaffold topology, effectors and physical form on cell/organ retention and pharmacokinetics of nanocarriers (polymer-bioconjugate and nanoparticle-types) in major sites of HIV infection; (3) To assess HIV-entry inhibition using nanocarriers with single and /or dual-receptor multiplex ligand binding; (4) To identify transferrin receptor (brain) and CD4 receptor (T-cell, macrophage) binding peptides using a state ofthe art T7 random peptide phage display library and an endocytosis-based selection screening method and evaluate binding in vitro. In addition to delivering a drug payload, a significant advantage of designing nanocarrier bioconjugates that bind to target cell surface receptors is that it is possible to block HIV entry into cells offering a second pathway for reducing/eradicating HIV infection. The proposed MERIT renewal focuses on continuing mechanistic active targeting approaches utilizing novel nanocarriers and peptidic targeting ligands as well as translationai studies that will enable the clinical development of these promising therapeutics. The multiplicity of activities resulting from drug delivery and targeting approaches complements pharmacological approaches and should result in improved potency, bioefficacy and patient outcomes. RELEVANCE (See Instructions): The relatively poor potency of existing anti-AIDS drugs requires that frequent and high doses be administered. Utilizing a nanotechnology approach, the proposed research will develop novel anti-HIV therapeutics that will dramatically increase potency resulting in reduced doses, less frequent administration, reduced side effects, higher patient compliance rates and better therapeutic outcomes.","6A"
2013,8417773,"5 R01 AI076276-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goals of the proposed work are to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in transcriptional regulation in the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum. During the malaria infection, the red blood cell stage of Plasmodium development is responsible for all of the clinical manifestations of this disease. This developmental stage is characterized by a cyclical 48-hour growth and replication phase that must be exquisitely regulated at the transcriptional level to maximize developmental efficiency and fidelity. The mechanisms used by the parasite to achieve this high level of transcriptional control remain unclear, although there is mounting evidence that transcription is strictly regulated in this organism. Our hypothesis is that a recently identified set of putative transcriptional regulators - the Apicomplexan AP2 (ApiAP2) proteins - are a major family of key transcriptional regulators during parasite development. The role of ApiAP2 proteins as transcriptional regulators will be analyzed using biochemistry, molecular biology and functional genomics tools. The first approach will determine the DNA recognition sequences for ApiAP2 proteins in vitro using two complementary methods. One method is a PCR-based selective enrichment of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) using recombinant ApiAP2 proteins and a random library of putative DNA binding sites. Alternatively, a protein binding microarray (PBM) will be used to hybridize ApiAP2 proteins to a comprehensive collection of double stranded oligonucleotides. The second approach will be to establish the in vivo role of ApiAP2 proteins by 1) modulating transcriptional levels of these putative regulators and 2) generating knockout parasite lines. The effects of these genetic modifications will be assayed globally using DNA microarrays to detect changes in gene expression. Next, the binding of ApiAP2 proteins to DNA will be measured in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation with DNA microarray detection (ChIP-chip). These results will define the gene sets directly regulated by the ApiAP2 proteins and will be compared to the in vitro binding results in Aim 2 as well as to prior gene expression data to establish a model for stage-specific transcriptional regulation during parasite development. Finally, we plan to establish and experimentally verify a peptide- based signaling motif that will allow us to predict the active nuclear localization of Plasmodial proteins. The ApiAP2 proteins are the first large family of putative transcription factor domains identified in the genome of P. falciparum and hold great promise for antimalarial intervention since there are no mammalian counterparts to these proteins.","2D"
2013,8418632,"5 R01 AI093307-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although HIV-infected long-term nonprogressors (LTNP) and those on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) have undetectable virus in blood; it is known that virus persists in yet unknown tissue reservoir(s) in essentially all HIV-infected patients throughout the course of infection. A number of tissue reservoirs have been proposed to harbor HIV-1. However, emerging evidence indicates gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is the major site of viral persistence and reservoir. However, technical challenges and risks limit progress in adequately defining tissue reservoirs in HIV-infected patients. These reasons mandate an assessment of tissue reservoirs using an animal model. Previously, we established a nonhuman primate model using SIV- infected rhesus macaques of Chinese origin (Ch Rh). We found that SIVmac239 infection in Ch Rh more closely mimics HIV-1 infection than other nonhuman primate models. Further, approximately 1/3 of Ch Rh spontaneously control SIV infection despite residual virus in tissues. Recently, we have discovered that the Ch Rh is the premier animal model for studying reservoirs under HAART. The recent addition of integrase inhibitors to the HIV therapeutic arsenal has demonstrated remarkable suppression when combined with standard HAART. Furthermore, we have found that Ch Rh, when treated with anti-SIV regimens that include integrase inhibitors have maximal suppression (< 30 copies/ml) virus in plasma, a feat that had yet to be achieved in a nonhuman primate model. We now have a unique model that can be utilized to test our hypothesis that the intestinal tract is the greatest reservoir for SIV in spontaneous viral controllers or on HAART, and determine whether novel strategies of treatment lead to eventually eradicate virus from these reservoirs. Here we propose: Aim 1. Identify the cellular and tissue reservoirs in SIV-infected macaques on HAART and those that become elite controllers. Using a novel combination of RT inhibitors and integrase inhibitors we will reduce viremia to <10 RNA copies/ml in plasma of treated NP. We will quantify and compare cellular and tissue reservoirs in the intestinal tract, bone marrow, spleen, and other tissues to determine the major reservoirs, we will also analyze viral mutations and evolution among NP on HAART, without HAART and LTNP to examine their association with viral reservoir and combination antiretroviral therapy. Aim 2. Assess the potential for eradication of virus from infected hosts by combining HAART with supplemental regimens or tissue-targeted strategies in early SIV infection. Novel antiviral strategies continue to emerge for HIV infection, and we will incorporate some of the latest antiviral regimens in the SIV-macaque model. For example, we are currently testing fusion inhibitors in macaques, and these may be combined with the above therapy in an attempt to quantify the decay of cell and tissue reservoirs in macaques on multiple drug combinations. Further, we may design specific strategies to target specific sites using the knowledge gained in Aim1 to successful viral eradication. The proposed research will provide new insights into the mechanisms of HIV persistence and latency, and assess whether eradication may be a feasible goal. Finally, these data may identify useful targets for novel therapeutic or vaccine approaches. )","2B,6A"

These studies will build on a powerful set of preliminary data that implicate several short and long non-coding RNAs in the regulation of HIV and response to METH. We propose to integrate several state-of-the-art post-genome technologies and newly developed experimental methodologies, including next generation sequencing and nanoparticle delivery systems, to provide important insights into the activity of these molecules in both promoting and restricting HIV replication. These analyses are designed to comprehensively identify non-coding RNAs that regulate these processes in primary human macrophages, and experimentally delineate their cellular or viral targets.

2013,8418691,"5 R21 AI098524-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Monocytes are precursors of dendritic cells and macrophages, and these cell types play an important and multifaceted role in HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis. Undifferentiated primary monocytes are resistant to HIV-1 postentry infection, which is likely due to the expression of a potential restriction factor. A challenge in he field is to identify the host factor and understand its mechanisms underlying HIV-1 restriction of primary monocytes. In our preliminary study, we identified a cellular protein named UBE2V1 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 1) that can inhibit HIV-1 infection in monocytic cells. The goal of this R21 proposal is to explore the function and mechanisms of UBE2V1 in blocking HIV-1 infection in primary monocytes. We propose to test the hypothesis that post-translationally modified UBE2V1 inhibits HIV-1 replication in primary monocytes. The expected outcome of our proposed studies is to define a novel mechanism by which post-translational modifications of UBE2V1 regulate HIV-1 infection in monocyte-lineage cells. UBE2V1 (also called UEV1, UEV1A or CROC-1) belongs to the subfamily of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant proteins and acts as a regulatory protein in DNA damage and cell differentiation. A recent study indicated that the retroviral restriction factor TRIM5 functions as an innate immune sensor for the retrovirus capsid lattice by interacting with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex UBC13-UBE2V1. This finding suggests that UBE2V1 is a novel component of the innate immune response. Interestingly, our preliminary studies indicate that post-translational modification of UBE2V1 is associated with HIV-1 restriction in primary monocytes. We propose to explore the role and mechanisms of UBE2V1 in HIV-1 restriction in primary monocytes in two specific aims. Aim 1. Characterize UBE2V1-mediated restriction of the HIV-1 early lifecycle in primary monocytes. Aim 2. Define the critical domains and residues of the modified UBE2V1 responsible for HIV-1 restriction in primary monocytes. The significant impact of our proposed studies will be to open a new area in the study of post- translational modifications of host factor involved in HIV-1 replication. We will define the molecular mechanism of HIV-1 restriction in monocyte-lineage cells by characterizing the function of UBE2V1 in HIV-1 infection. Accomplishing the proposed aims has the potential to advance basic knowledge of HIV-host interactions. Ultimately, the knowledge learned from the proposed studies will enable design of novel approaches to block HIV-1 replication in target cells.","2B"

While global this mostly affects developing countries and regions with prevalent HIV/AIDS problems, and leads to an urgent need to find novel anti-TB lead compounds. The lack of success in finding such compounds by screening synthetic libraries directs the focus of interest back to the chemically diverse natural products. The constraints of classical bioactivity guided isolation are labor intensity, time commitment, and most important, the difficulty in detecting, isolating, and characterizing bioactive minor constituents. The present exploratory project will lay the groundwork for a transformative concept to the rapid detection, isolation, and identification of anti-tuberculosis natural products. The technology will be developed on extracts of cultured actinomycete strains and will be a prerequisite for a large-scale anti- TB drug discovery project on a panel of pre-selected anti-TB active actinomycete strains. A novel TLC-MS-(TB)-bioautography method will be developed for the straight-forward identification of active key compounds in an analytical setting that allows the mass spectrometric analysis of planar chromatographic sample separations and in parallel the evaluation of their biological activity profile. Combining the mass spectroscopic with biological activity data will generate two-dimensional maps that directly correlate the anti-TB activity with structural information. The isolation procedure can significantly be shortened by using the knowledge of the chemical properties of the active principle in an early stage of the separation procedure. A specific protocol can be tailored with counter current chromatography based on the polarity based GUESS principle and/or to directly upscale to preparative TLC. State-of-the-art technology in planar chromatography (high-performance TLC, automated  spray-on  sampling, gradient elution, semi-automatic extraction), microbiology (TB agar-overlay with luminescence detection), and MS spectroscopy (LC-MS2) will be used to target the isolation of lead compounds. Known chemical structures will be dereplicated based on their molecular weight, as gleaned from MS (and LC-MS2) and EI database (NIST, Wiley) search. Full structure elucidation of new or otherwise important isolated active principles will utilize state-of-the-art 1D/2D NMR- and MS-based structural information and will be supported by novel methodology like cryoprobe NMR, nuclear fingerprinting and purity-activity relationships based on quantitative NMR and modern anti-TB activity assessment. TLC-MS-(TB)-bioautography will be compared with established technologies, optimized, and validated. The concept can generally be applied in natural product drug discovery to handle large quantities of samples and will in our case be applied to pre-selected anti-TB active actinomycete strains. We expect that application of this novel technology will result in the discovery of a plethora of new, heretofore unidentified anti-TB natural products and that one or more of these will be a viable lead compound for TB drug development.","6D"

They include mild cosmetic symptoms, recurrent skin and mucosal surface infections, and the rarer life-threatening diseases caused by disseminated fungi particularly in immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from AIDS, undergoing chemotherapy or corticosteroid therapy, and organ transplant recipients. Currently there is a limited repertoire of drugs available to treat fungi. Some species are naturally resistance to these drugs and resistance can be acquired in clinical settings. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new treatments for fungal diseases. The objective of this proposal is to identify suitable targets for drug development in fungi, using a model organism Cryptococcus neoformans (in phylum Basidiomycota). This fungus is very diverged and different from commonly studied pathogenic or model species like Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe (in phylum Ascomycota), and thus discoveries made in this organism are expected to extend across all pathogenic fungi. The specific aim of the proposed research is to identify essential genes of C. neoformans, using two experimental approaches. Essential genes are those required for viability: because mutants cannot grow, the identification of essential genes is a technical challenge. Here these genes will be identified by an innovative genetic screen and through a bioinformatic prioritization to essential genes found in fungi but not in humans. The proposal will also generate a resource of heterozygous strains suitable for small molecule studies utilizing haplo-insufficiency. The discovery of these essential genes represents new avenues for the development of antifungal agents.","6D"
2013,8418725,"5 R21 AI098581-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently there have been important discoveries of potent and broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bnMAb) isolated from chronically HIV-infected individuals. It will likely follow that attempts will be made to re-elicit such antibody responses through the rational design of immunogens based on these discoveries. Despite having potent and broad neutralizing activity, the serum used to generate these bnMAbs did not however produce sterilizing immunity in the infected individuals from which they were isolated nor did they neutralize all of the Tier 1-2 viruses that were tested, suggesting potential escape variants. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to characterize escape from these broad and potent neutralizing antibodies. The major aims are to (1) map the escape pathways used by a panel of primary acute and chronic HIV molecular clones in the development of resistance to these bnMAbs, (2) determine whether escape from one broadly neutralizing antibody changes the sensitivity to a different broadly neutralizing antibody due to global changes in the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) structure, and (3) understand whether the escape mutation(s) alter(s) the fitness of the resulting variant. To accomplish these aims, a panel of HIV clones that express early and late time-point Envs will be serially-passaged in the presence of bnMAbs (i.e. VRC01, VRC03, PG9 and PG16) to drive immunological escape. Then, sequential samples will be analyzed at each passage of the virus to chart the (i) accumulation of genetic mutations and (ii) development of resistance. Once escape mutants are generated and identified, neutralization assays with each escape mutant using the other bnMAbs will be performed. Moreover, escape mutant Envs will be subcloned into a replication-competent HIV background to determine whether the mutation(s) also affect the fitness of the virus. The information gained in this study is highly relevant to rational immunogen design, since it (i) deepens the understanding of the mechanisms used by primary Envs to escape from bnMAbs, (ii) may identify second-site and/or off-target mutations in Env that are involved in escape from bnMAbs, and (iii) may provide an estimate of the number of epitope targets that are needed to afford protective immunity against not only the transmitted founder virus, but also its possible escape variants. In the aggregate, this project is highly relevant to an understanding of the requirements for an effective vaccine that could prevent acquisition of HIV/AIDS.","4A"

Despite the development of effective therapies, there is an ongoing need to identify novel drug targets for improving the treatment of HIV infection. A poorly understood area of HIV biology is the stage in the virus infection process termed uncoating, which involves disassembly of the polymeric viral capsid from the viral core after entry into the cell. In collaboration with Pfizer Global Research and Development, we have begun to characterize the mechanism of novel small molecule HIV-1 inhibitors that target the viral capsid. Preliminary results indicate that these inhibitors block HIV-1 infection at an early stage by triggering premature uncoating of the virus in the target cell. This proposal includes a comprehensive plan involving the tools of structural biology, cell biology, and virology to define the molecular target and detailed mechanism of action of such capsid-targeting HIV-1 inhibitors. The Specific Aims are: 1. To determine the structural consequences of PF-03450074 binding to the HIV-1 capsid. 2. To determine whether PF-03450074 promotes premature HIV-1 uncoating in target cells. 3. To determine the spectrum of mutations that confers resistance to PF-03450074. 4. To determine the mechanistic basis for the effects of the cyclophilin A-CA interaction on HIV-1  sensitivity to PF-03450074. 5. To determine the molecular basis of the late-stage inhibition by PF-03450074. The proposed research will identify a novel mechanism to inhibit HIV-1 infection, will reveal the structure of the target thereby facilitating the design of lead compounds for drug development, and will reveal new insights into the biology of HIV-1 infection.","6A"

After release from incarceration, relapse to opioid addiction is very common and this leads to more crimes and re-incarceration. Treatment advances in the area of medications have not reached this population. Effective medications such as methadone and buprenorphine are not well accepted by prosecutors and judges. Permission to conduct research on the most effective treatment approaches is very difficult to obtain for patients under legal restraint because informed consent is problematic. Naltrexone, an opiate receptor antagonist, has demonstrated pharmacological efficacy in preventing relapse to opioid addiction and it has been reported to be clinically effective in parolee populations although it is rarely used. Recently a depot formulation with a one month duration has received FDA approval for the treatment of alcoholism. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a monthly injection of naltrexone is practical and useful in the prevention of relapse and when compared to treatment as usual. We will also monitor HIV risk behaviors to determine whether the intervention reduces risk of HIV and hepatitis C infections. This collaborative project will take place in six treatment sites where there is a large population of parolees with a history of opiate addiction. In order to prevent even a subtle form of coercion, referrals from parole officers will not be accepted. After determining that all volunteers are opiate free by urine test and not currently opiate dependent using a naloxone test, they will be randomized to depot naltrexone or Treatment as Usual (TAU). Participants in both groups will be given identical follow up monthly for six months with measures of opiate use by self-report, urine test and hair analysis. An additional random urine test will take place each month between monthly visits. Both groups will be re-evaluated six and 12 months later. The University of Pennsylvania will be the coordinating site and each site will have a randomization goal of 20 new patients per year over 3.5 to 4 years to accrue a total of 360 to 400 participants. Treatment outcome will be measured by urine tests, hair analysis, self-report and continuation in treatment. Both naltrexone and comparison groups will receive equivalent voucher incentives to remain in the program. A benefit-cost analysis will be conducted to compare the costs of the treatment with the quantifiable benefits in terms of reduced crime, re-incarceration and medical services and increased employment.","1A"
2013,8418747,"5 R01 AI087139-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In many settings in Africa, women with unknown HIV status present late in pregnancy or in labor, and the postpartum period represents a major entry point for counseling, testing, and assessment for antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. ARV use in pregnant and breastfeeding women has clear benefits for mothers and infants. Furthermore, if an infant is already HIV-infected, breastfeeding is seen as posing no risk to the infant, and women are strongly encouraged to continue breastfeeding to maximize survival of the infant. However, use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in breastfeeding women may induce ARV resistance in some HIV-infected infants, either through transfer of ARV-resistant strains from the mother to the infant, or by exposing the infant to biologically significant but sub-therapeutic amounts of ARV drugs, leading to selection of ARV-resistant HIV in infants who are already infected with ARV-susceptible HIV. Development of ARV resistance to more than one class of ARV drugs (multi-class resistance) in HIV-infected infants is likely to significantly reduce their chance of responding to life-saving ARV therapy. The hypothesis of this study is that maternal HAART induces multi-class ARV resistance in the majority of HIV-infected breastfeeding infants. This hypothesis will be tested using samples and data from the Post-Exposure Prophylaxis of Infants (PEPI) trial that was conducted in Blantyre, Malawi. In PEPI, approximately 90 women who initiated HAART postpartum had infants who were HIV-infected. Women and infants in PEPI received ARV drugs for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (pMTCT). Most women (~70%) received single dose nevirapine (sdNVP). All infants received sdNVP and 1 week of zidovudine (control regimen). Infants were then randomized at birth to receive either the control regimen alone, or the control regimen plus up to 14 weeks of extended daily NVP or extended daily NVP plus extended daily ZDV. These regimens were stopped immediately in infants with confirmed HIV infection. Because these pMTCT regimens are known to cause selection of NVP-resistant HIV in some women and some HIV-infected infants, exposure to pMTCT regimens will be considered in our analysis. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: Aim 1: Test whether initiation of maternal HAART postpartum is associated with emergence of multi-class resistance in HIV- infected breastfeeding infants. Aim 2: Analyze HIV viral load, ARV drug levels, and HIV drug resistance in breast milk samples from women on HAART. These studies will quantify the prevalence of multi-class resistance in infant plasma and breast milk after maternal HAART initiation, and will identify factors associated with development of multi-class resistance in HIV-infected breastfeeding infants. These studies will also assess whether infants in this setting are more likely to acquire multi-class resistance from transmission of resistant HIV from the mother (selected from her HAART regimen), or from exposure to ARV drugs in breast milk. This information will facilitate the design and implementation of strategies for HIV prevention and treatment in resource-constrained settings.","1A,6E"

Children born to HIV-infected women may also be at generally higher risk for neurodevelopmental delay and mortality than children born to HIV-uninfected women in resource limited settings. At least 10 million HIV-uninfected children have been born to HIV-infected mothers over the past 10 years, and the use of ARVs in pregnancy is being rapidly scaled up globally. It is important to determine the consequences of both perinatal HIV-1 and ARV exposure, in order to help inform the rational selection of specific ARVs for MTCT prevention or allay existing concerns about their use, and to improve overall health outcomes among HIV-exposed children. In Botswana, one in three pregnant women is infected with HIV-1, reflecting a generalized epidemic that affects all social strata. The Botswana Harvard School of Public Health AIDS Initiative Partnership (BHP) has conducted clinical research related to MTCT prevention and maternal/pediatric health in Botswana since 1999. We are uniquely positioned to simultaneously study the impact of perinatal ARV- and HIV exposure on child health and neurodevelopment. Our primary objectives are: 1. To compare neurodevelopmental outcomes following in utero exposure to 3-drug HAART that contains 2 or more nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), vs. monotherapy with a single NRTI (zidovudine), among HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-infected mothers with similar antenatal CD4+ cell counts. 2. To prospectively compare neurodevelopmental outcomes among HIV-exposed but uninfected children, vs. children born to HIV-uninfected women. 3. To prospectively compare the rates of mortality in HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-infected mothers vs. children born to HIV-uninfected women in a setting of HAART availability. 4. To prospectively determine the biologic and social factors that are most strongly associated with excess mortality and neurodevelopmental delay among HIV-exposed but uninfected children compared with HIV-unexposed children. To address these aims, we will prospectively enroll, follow, and test (until 2 years) two new cohorts: a cohort of 400 HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-infected mothers, as well as 400 children born to HIV-uninfected mothers, in Botswana. In addition, to address Aim 1, we will also perform neurodevelopmental testing (at 2 years of age) on a subset of a third, existing cohort: 730 children who were exposed perinatally to HAART in an ongoing clinical trial at these same locations.","2G"
2013,8418763,"5 R01 AI094599-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is an urgent need to understand the initiation and dissemination of HIV-1 infection in mucosal tissues, and to develop new methods for targeting early infection to prevent mucosal HIV-1 transmission. HIV-1 infection requires fusion of the viral and target cell membranes, a process mediated by the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) and host cell receptors. The human scavenger receptor gp340 has been identified as a secreted component in human saliva that inhibits oral transmission of HIV-1 through a specific interaction with the surface gp120 subunit of an Env spike. Surprisingly the gp120 interaction with the membrane-bound gp340 in the female reproductive tract promotes HIV-1 transcytosis through barrier epithelia and thus infection of CD4+ cells. Our goal in this program is to define the molecular target and mechanism of action of soluble gp340-based HIV-1 entry inhibitors. Our discovery effort will be based on preliminary data obtained with the gp120-binding SRCR domain of gp340 that potently inhibits in vitro infection by HIV-1 with nanomolar IC50 values. We propose a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach that combines protein chemistry, high- resolution structural determination, thermodynamic and kinetic binding analyses, protein engineering, molecular virology, and animal model efficacy studies. In this project we seek to discover novel HIV-1-specific intervention strategies to inhibit mucosal epithelium-Env binding and virus-cell fusion. The Specific Aims are: 1. To understand the structural basis of gp120 binding by gp340 to inform the design and optimization of novel SRCR domain entry inhibitors. (a) Elucidate the structural properties of the SRCR domain fragment both free and bound to the V3 region. (b) Characterize the energetics of the gp120-gp340 interaction. (c) Use mutational analysis and biophysical methods to dissect the structural determinants of the respective binding sites. (d) Define a  minimal  gp120-binding sequence or set of such sequences. (e) Optimize binding affinity of variants of the SRCR domain, and evaluate their anti-HIV-1 activity in a single-round infectivity assay. 2. To determine the mechanisms by which the gp120-gp340 interaction influences Env structure, function and antigenicity. (a) Determine how V3 mutations identified in Aim 1c influence the functional competence of Env. (b) Characterize the effects of the SRCR domain on the receptor-binding properties of gp120 and its reactivities to neutralizing and non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. (c) Determine the virucidal activity of select SRCR domain entry inhibitors against diverse primary HIV-1 strains. 3. To test the effectiveness of optimized SRCR domain entry inhibitors to protect against mucosal HIV-1 infection. (a) Characterize the specificity and potency of select SRCR entry inhibitors in an in vitro model of HIV-1 infection of human cervical and vaginal tissue. (b) Use the humanized mouse vaginal transmission model to assess the in vivo potency and breadth of activity of optimized SRCR entry inhibitors alone and in combination with the gp41 fusion inhibitor C52L and the small-molecule CCR5 coreceptor inhibitor CMPD167. 1","3A,3B"

2013,8418766,"5 R01 AI081559-05","PROJECT SUMMARY  Sexual transmission is the most common route of HIV infection and women account for nearly half of those infected worldwide. Prevention strategies employing different approaches are needed to reduce the probability of transmission. Epidemiological and clinical studies strongly indicate that sexually transmitted infections (STIs) increase the likelihood of HIV transmission. Although the contribution of STIs to the increase in HIV transmission is likely to be multifaceted, understanding how STIs enhance HIV infection is vital to the development of new strategies for the prevention of HIV.  Mammalian defensins are antimicrobial peptides important to innate host defense and play a role in mucosal immunity. Human defensins 5 and 6 (HD5 and HD6), the most abundant antimicrobial peptides in intestine, are constitutively expressed in Paneth cells but also found in the epithelium of the vagina and ectocervix. Induction of HD5 has been reported in the male urethra during C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infectioN, further supporting the role of defensins in the mucosal immunity against STIs. However, our recent publication indicates that HD5 and HD6 significantly enhance HIV infection at the step of viral entry. Using a cervicovaginal epithelial tissue culture system, we demonstrate that, for the first time, induction of HD5 and HD6 in response to gonococcal (GC) infection increases HIV infectivity. The HIV enhancing effect of HD5 and HD6 is more pronounced with R5 virus compared to X4 virus, suggesting its clinical significance as R5 viruses are almost exclusively detected upon sexual transmission. We hypothesize that STIs may contribute to increased HIV transmission by up-regulation of innate effectors that in turn promote HIV infectivity in the genital mucosa. The consequence of defensin-mediated enhancement of HIV infectivity may result in reduction of efficacy of potential microbicides and neutralizing antibodies.  The goal of this proposal is to dissect the molecular basis of defensin-mediated enhanced HIV infectivity and to assess transcriptional regulation of HD5 and HD6 in cervicovaginal epithelial cells in response to GC infection. We will define the role of HIV glycoprotein gp120 in defensin-mediated enhancement of HIV infectivity. We will investigate the molecular determinants for the HIV enhancing effect of HD5 and HD6. We will elucidate the mechanism underlying gene regulation of HD5 and HD6 by GC infection. This study will provide a better understanding of the complex function of defensins in HIV-1 pathogenesis and mucosal transmission and offer insight into the development of novel prevention strategies, especially in the setting of STIs.","2A"
2013,8419488,"5 F31 MH095649-02","Rakai, Uganda is characterized by a mature HIV epidemic and high rates of intimate partner violence (IPV). In 2005, adult HIV prevalence was 16% (women) and 12% (men) and incidence was 1.5/100 person-years (PY); while 20% and 14.5% of women reported physical or sexual IPV (respectively) during the past year. This represents a significant public health concern because women who experience IPV are at increased risk for HIV acquisition and HIV-infected women are at increased risk for IPV. Although select interventions have independently reduced HIV and IPV, no one-dimensional approach has successfully decreased both outcomes. The objective of the proposed research is to assess the impact of the Safe Homes And Respect for Everyone (SHARE) Project, a combination HIV/IPV intervention conducted by Rakai Health Sciences Program (RHSP). The SHARE design was based on the Transtheoretical Model of behavior change and included work with community volunteers, health mobilization and education, capacity building activities, advocacy, media and special events. A cluster randomized trial design was used and data were collected via the parent study, the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS), which collects survey and biological data every 12-18 months with all consenting people aged 15-49. At baseline there were 47 active RCCS communities grouped into 11 clusters, 4 of which were assigned to the intervention arm and 7 to the control arm of the trial. Intervention areas were exposed to SHARE and RHSP services including HIV testing, provision of ART and pre-ART care, general medical care, prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, family planning, health education and community mobilization. Control areas were not exposed to SHARE but were exposed to RHSP services. Impact assessment was done through RCCS surveys and HIV serology done pre-intervention (Feb 2005-June 2006) and at 2 post-intervention follow-ups (Aug 2006-Nov 2009). A total of 14,119 participants (3,316 in intervention communities and 10,803 in control communities) were enrolled at baseline. The proposed research has 3 aims. Aim 1: To assess the impact of the intervention on the period prevalence of physical and/or sexual IPV in the past 12 months compared to the control communities. Adjusted prevalence risk ratios (PRR) will be estimated using log-binomial or modified Poisson regression with random effects models to account for within-cluster correlation. Aim 2: To assess the impact of the intervention on HIV incidence compared with control communities. An intention-to-treat approach will be followed using a log link and Poisson distribution to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRR) of HIV acquisition per 100 PY, using random effects models to account for intra-cluster correlation and adjusting by cluster. Aim 3: To assess the impact of the intervention on sexual risk behaviors (non-marital partnerships in the past year, condom use over the past 6 months and use of alcohol before sex) compared to the control communities. PRRs will be estimated using log-binomial or modified Poisson regression with random effects models to account for correlation within clusters.","7A"
2013,8420190,"4 R21 AI096940-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV elicits the production of antibodies in the infected individual. Whereas for most, this response is highly specific for the particular viral isolate of infection, there are some individuals that mount broadly cross neutralizing antibodies that appear to keep the virus in check. It is assumed that such cross neutralizing activity is central i combating AIDS and would be a necessary attribute of a prophylactic AIDS vaccine. Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to critically analyze the antibody response towards HIV and profile the specificities correlated with virus neutralization. Current serological methods, however, are tedious, laborious and of unsatisfactory resolution, classifying antibody specificities to gross chunks of the HIV envelope. Here we propose a novel and much improved technological platform that generates exceptionally high resolution profiles of the antibody specificities of polyclonal serum with relative ease, low cost and at high throughput. The essence of the technology is the combination of two new methods; a phage display library of a comprehensive array of HIV envelope peptides/domains ranging in length from 50 to 300 amino acids, and a unique vector system that converts phage display compatible with second generation DNA cyclic sequencing. Together, this methodology, coined Deep Panning of Domain Scan libraries, enables one to analyze the complete antibody repertoire of selected polyclonal sera. The data output generated consists of hundreds of thousands of affinity isolated peptides corresponding to HIV envelope segments. In this study feasibility of the methods and evaluation of their utility and productivity will be tested using a panel of >400 well characterize serum samples of HIV infected individuals that range in their neutralizing capacity from non-existent/weak to extraordinarily potent (top 2% of the collection). Selected sera will be subjected to Deep Panning and the data sets to be generated will be classified implementing machine learning computational methods. These will produce a profile of those epitopes that best correlate with HIV neutralization. It is proposed that this information will be extremely useful fo our understanding of mechanisms of HIV neutralization and as guides to rational vaccine design. Moreover, the proof of feasibility in this pilot study will serve as the basis for more elaborate and comprehensive studies targeted to better understand HIV correlates of immunity, disease progression and prevention of AIDS.","4A"
2013,8420409,"5 R01 AI097213-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are studying the human virome in children with fever. For the purposes of these studies, the human virome is defined as the total collection of viruses infecting humans, including viruses causing acute, persistent, or latent infection, but not including bacteriophages or viruses integrated into the human genome without evidence of replicative capacity. Children with fever are frequently infected with viruses and thus are very suitable for early studies of the human virome. In this project, previous studies on normal children with and without fever will be extended to include immunocompromised children. The reasons for studying immunocompromised children are 1) to increase our knowledge of the viruses causing fever in immunocompromised children to improve their medical management, 2) to learn about the influence of the immune system on the composition of the human virome, and 3) to search for novel viruses that might be present in these children because of their immunocompromised state. A series of studies will also be performed to improve the system we have already established for using high throughput nucleotide sequencing to define the human virome. Thus, this project will enroll 400 children who are immunocompromised for varying reasons including receipt of a hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant, presence of a congenital immunodeficiency, HIV/AIDS, and treatment of diseases with medications that suppress the immune system. Samples of blood, nasopharyngeal secretions, and stool will be collected from 200 children on a single occasion to survey the viruses that are present. In addition, the same set of samples will also be collected from 100 children having episodes of fever, at the time of the febrile episode and 1 and 6 months later. Finally, in order to study directly the effects of the immune system on the virome, the same set of samples will be collected from 100 children who are undergoing transplantation before the transplant and 1 and 6 months later. Samples will be analyzed using comprehensive panels of virus-specific PCR assays and by next generation high throughput nucleotide sequencing. In order to refine the established pipeline for detecting viruses by metagenomic sequencing, a series of new computational methods to detect known and novel viruses will be investigated. New platforms for high throughput sequencing that may allow longer sequencing reads or increased numbers of reads will also be evaluated. Finally investigations of novel viruses detected will be carried out, including whole genome sequencing and investigations of their prevalence and clinical manifestations using virus-specific PCR assays designed based on the nucleotide sequence. This project is expected to provide medically useful information about the range of viruses producing illness in immunocompromised children and should greatly improve methods for studying the human virome.","2D"
2013,8420429,"5 R21 AI099494-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In addition to recognizing antigens (Ags) via the T cell receptor (TCR), CD4+T cells can recognize microbial patterns through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Human CD4+ T cells can directly recognize mycobacterial lipoproteins via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). In combination with TCR triggering, TLR2 engagement induces CD4+T cell proliferation and secretion of IL-2 and IFN-¿ . The role of TLR2 expressed on CD4+ T cells in T cell activation/differentiation in vivo and its impact on immune responses to M. tuberculosis (Mtb) remains unexplored. One major challenge in understanding T cell TLR2 role in Mtb infection is the lack of adequate animal models to isolate the effects of TLR2 signaling in lymphoid cells from those triggered by TLR2 signaling in myeloid cells. Considering that TLR2 ligands are major components of the Mtb cell wall and traffic inside and outside the infected macrophages, it is important to establish their effects in different immune cells in vivo. This proposal is aimed at defining the role of TLR2 ligand recognition by CD4+ T cells in Mtb infection and after immunization with Mtb antigens using novel in vivo models. We hypothesize that direct recognition of mycobacterial TLR2 ligands by CD4+T cells: a) generates signals that up-regulate Th1 and multifunctional CD4+T cell responses in Mtb infection in vivo; b) results in enhanced immune protection against Mtb; c) can be targeted by vaccine adjuvants to generate stronger memory and recall responses to Mtb. These hypotheses will be tested with two specific Aims: Aim 1. Establish the role TLR2 expressed on CD4+T cells in the immune response to Mtb infection. Aim 2. Determine the impact of mycobacterial TLR2 ligand recognition by CD4+T cells in generation of memory and recall responses to Mtb antigens. To test our hypotheses, we will correlate TLR2 expression on CD4+ T cells with T cell expansion/effector function/differentiation in vivo in an Mtb aerosol infection model. To asses the effect of TLR2 deficiency in CD4+T cells on immune responses to Mtb infection and to immunization we will use two approaches: a) adoptive transfer of Mtb specific-TCR transgenic (Tg) CD4+T cells isolated from Tlr2+/- or from Tlr2-/- mice; b) generation of new conditional knockout mouse strain where TLR2 is selectively deleted in T cells (Tlr2flox/flox x CD4-Cre mice= Tlr2¿T mice). Our long-term goal is to understand mechanisms that protect against Mtb infection and/or prevent progression to TB disease and apply this knowledge to development of new vaccines. Our immediate goal is to establish the role of TLR2 ligand recognition by CD4+T cells in immune defense against Mtb. Also, we will determine the potential of targeting CD4+T cell expressed-TLR2 with vaccine adjuvants to improve recall responses and protection. In addition to expanding our understanding of the host-pathogen interaction in Mtb infection, this research project may provide new targets for adjuvants, i.e. CD4+T cell TLR2.","6D"
2013,8420484,"5 R01 AI092120-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this work is to identify vaccine candidates to prevent severe malaria syndromes through understanding natural protective immune response. Plasmodium falciparum parasite-infected erythrocytes (IE) adhere to the host endothelium and to red blood cells. The adhesion is mediated by a large family (~60 members) of parasite multidomain variant proteins called PfEMP1. They express on the surface of IE in a mutually-exclusive manner. IE adhesion may result in severe complications including cerebral malaria, pregnancy malaria, severe anemia and respiratory distress, major contributors to malaria mortality. Severe malaria episodes are rare and almost never occur more than 1 or 2 times in a lifetime. This epidemiology supports our first hypothesis that only a limited number of parasite lines, possibly expressing particular variants of PfEMP1 that determine specific parasite adhesion, may be the source of severe disease.  Immunological profiling of sera for reactivity against different antigens is an important method for assessing acquired immunity and identifying potential vaccine candidates. However, relating immune responses to malaria resistance is not straightforward since exposed individuals are typically infected repeatedly throughout life, and develop diversified immune responses against multiple antigens, in many cases without comprehensible relevance to disease severity. Our second hypothesis is that functional antibody responses that inhibit adhesion of IE to host receptors are likely to have a stronger association to protection from severe malaria. Extensive studies in pregnancy malaria strongly support both our hypotheses.  During our previous work we collected thousands of serum samples obtained in longitudinal cohort studies of children living in malaria endemic areas of Africa. We also constructed functional genome-wide PfEMP1 domain arrays and used them to identify domains that bind specifically to the two main adhesion host receptors in malaria (ICAM1 and CD36). We further demonstrated that total anti-domain IgG and functional antibodies (that block adhesion of PfEMP1 domain to its receptor) can be quantified in the plasma samples using our multiplexed high throughput sample-sparing platform. To better understand the protective humoral immune responses in severe malaria, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Measure serum total IgG reactivity against a genome-wide array of PFEMP1 domains, and measure functional serum activity that inhibits CD36 and ICAM1 receptor binding to relevant PFEMP1 domains. We will test about 5000 children's sera including ~200-400 severe malaria cases. 2) Associate defined antibody responses (total and functional) against PfEMP1 domains with disease parameters and protection against severe disease. We will perform a broad range of statistical analyses using the longitudinal data obtained in Aim 1. This would be the first genome-wide study of seroreactivity and a comprehensive study of functional immune responses against PfEMP1 proteins. This study may provide candidates for development of vaccines against severe malaria.","6D"
2013,8420526,"5 R01 AI030914-18","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than a quarter of a century after the first AIDS cases were described, the basic immunologic mechanisms that control HIV-1 remain unknown. Induction of HIV-1-specific CD8 T cells is associated with a decline in plasma viremia following acute infection, but neither the magnitude nor breadth of these responses, as measured by IFN-3 expression, is correlated with disease control. These assays do not assess the ability of CTL to recognize and kill virus- infected cells. Indeed, the properties currently measured may simply reflect the level of viremia, rather than reveal causes of immune control. We hypothesize that identifying key antiviral effector functions in CTL, and potential defects in these activities, will require direct examination of the interaction between T cells and live HIV-1-infected cells, which has never been comprehensively analyzed. During previous funding periods of this grant, we developed a robust in vitro viral inhibition assay that allows identification of T cells that control HIV-1 replication. Our data indicate that this short-term co-culture assay readily distinguishes functional and non-functional CTL: even within a single individual, we observed 1,000-fold differences between T cells with differing specificities. This powerful tool allows for detailed cellular and molecular analyses, since each component of the system (CTL, virus, and target cell) can be manipulated individually. We now propose to define CTL populations that inhibit HIV-1 infection in vitro and to directly assess the molecular pathways involved in antiviral control and loss of CTL function. Specifically we propose to: 1) Identify CTL epitope specificities that are best able to control HIV-1 replication in vitro; 2) Determine the impact of TCR and viral sequence variation on CTL avidity, cell signaling, and antiviral inhibition capacity; and 3) Define essential antiviral CTL effector molecules and important regulatory pathways in CTL using gene expression analysis, over-expression vectors, and RNAi technology. These studies are highly relevant to vaccine design and testing since they will provide critical new data to enhance our understanding of antiviral CTL function and they will identify viral regions that are efficiently targeted by host CTL that can be incorporated into novel immunogens.","4A"

The described seronegative state of subjects known to be at risk of infection via shared needle behavior with persons of unknown status has heightened interest in identifying the mechanism(s) of immune control that may provide resistance to infection in association with HIV exposure and drug use. NK cell activation, increased constitutive degranulation and increased lytic activity, have been proposed in EU-IVDU as a critical feature associated with protection, yet it remains unknown what specific NK membrane protein profiles and functional responses best defines or identifies an NK or DC cell activation program in EU-IVDU. The effects of drug use on NK or PDC activation programs, even in the absence of repeated HIV exposure, are also unknown. We propose to analyze three groups identified by lack of HIV infection (serongative) with different histories of IV opioid drug use. Three groups of 50 subjects each will be recruited for this study as follows: Group 1: EU-IVDU for >3 yrs, Group 2: Clean users (not needle sharing)-IVU users and Group 3: uninfected-non IVU users. For each of the drug user groups a 1:1 recruitment will take place between exclusive opioid users and opioid and non-injectable drug use in absence of dependence to the latter. For all groups, we will collect blood and characterize circulating immune cell subsets by flow cytometry while preparing PBMC and isolated NK cell subsets for analysis with and without an acute stimulation with Interferon-alpha. Interferon-alpha is chosen as a reference activation stimuli based for its role in activating NK lysis of HIV-infected targets as shown in preliminary data. For Aim 1, we will complete an analysis defining the molecular phenotype of NK cells in the EU-IVDU by (1) measuring activation (i.e., CD69), regulatory (i.e., Np44, etc.), IFN-gamma/chemokine secretion, and STAT-1 signaling potential; (2) using proteomics-based methods to compare global and cell surface protein profiles on NK cells to identify key cellular pathways and cell surface receptors selectively associated with EU-IVDU (KIR3DL1, KIR3DS1). We anticipate to find unique differences in group 1 as compared to groups 2 and 3. Aim 2 will analyze NK and DC-dependent NK activation potential in conjunction with protein expression of KIR associated with disease control or the Plasmacytoid DC secretome after TLR-7 stimulation (associated with HIV-dependent PDC-mediated NK activation). Constitutive circulating NK CD107a and in vitro activity of PDC and cytotoxic function of NK cells when co-cultured with autologous HIV-1 infected targets (with and without IFN-1 stimulation) will be done anticipating to show greater NK activation and lysis in Group 1 as compared to 2 or 3. Taken together, the proposed work will test the hypothesis that a defined NK and pDC activation phenotype mediates both soluble and direct antiviral function in EU-IVDU, thereby decreasing HIV-1 infection efficiency upon IV exposure.","1C"
2013,8420541,"5 R01 AI084913-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mucosal tissues represent the most common sites of infection. Establishing memory CD8 T cells at mucosal sites through vaccination may be critical for protecting the host against certain infections, including HIV. However, surprisingly little is known about the properties of memory CD8 T cells within the gastrointestinal and genital mucosa, the mechanisms that regulate their establishment, maintenance and differentiation state, and most importantly, what mucosal memory CD8 T cells within these tissues actually contribute to protection from local infections. These gaps in knowledge represent a major barrier to the successful development of protective CD8 T cell vaccines against mucosal pathogens. The main goal of this proposal is to use mouse models of infection to determine how protective CD8 T cell immunity is regulated at mucosal surfaces. To address this question, we will: 1) define mechanisms that regulate location-specific mucosal memory CD8 T cell differentiation states, 2) determine processes that govern CD8 T cell migration and maintenance within mucosal tissues, and 3) test the relationship between memory CD8 T cell location and differentiation state and the ability of the host to protect itself against intracellular pathogens encountered at mucosal surfaces. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that establishing protective CD8 T cell immunity at mucosal portals of infection is controlled by three processes: developmental cues during priming within lymphoid tissues, the regulation of antigen-specific T cell trapping within mucosal parenchyma, and location specific cues that vary among different mucosal tissues and control memory T cell differentiation programs. Our studies may provide information for the design of vaccines that optimally establish protective CD8 T cell immunity at mucosal portals of infection.","2C"
2013,8420970,"1 R01 AI103280-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plasmodium falciparum is a protozoan pathogen that causes the deadliest form of malaria. Malaria has a tremendous impact on human health worldwide, causing nearly one million deaths per year. New therapies are urgently needed to treat this disease, due to widespread chloroquine resistance and emerging resistance to artemisinins. P. falciparum possesses an essential metabolic pathway, non-mevalonate isoprenoid biosynthesis (the MEP pathway), which is not present in humans. This pathway is a particularly enticing antimalarial drug target because it is shared by other important human pathogens, including Gram-negative bacteria and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The long-term goal is to understand why isoprenoids are essential in malaria parasites. Fosmidomycin is a validated inhibitor of the MEP pathway and is currently in Phase II clinical trials of combination therapy to treat malaria. In preliminary studies, a collection of fosmidomycin-resistant malaria parasites have been developed that not only lack mutations in the known targets of this drug but also continue to grow even when isoprenoid biosynthesis is inhibited. These fosmidomycin-resistant strains presumably survive through genetic changes in a  rescue pathway.  The objective of this proposal is to determine the biochemical and genetic mechanisms by which these parasites have become resistant. The rationale for these studies is that identification of the genes and pathways that genetically interact with fosmidomycin will inform the regulation and downstream biology of isoprenoid biosynthesis in P. falciparum. Understanding how fosmidomycin-resistant malaria strains survive, despite inhibition of isoprenoid biosynthesis, will  elucidate why isoprenoids are typically essential. This approach takes advantage of a pathogen-specific biochemical pathway and a potent chemical inhibitor of isoprenoid biosynthesis that is already in clinical trials. Supported by strong preliminary data that indicate that this strategy wll be successful, the objectives will be met through three specific aims: 1) metabolic analysis of MEP metabolism and protein prenylation (an important function of isoprenoid biosynthesis) in fosmidomycin-resistant malaria parasites; 2) genetic analysis of fosmidomycin-resistant malaria parasites through next-generation sequencing strategies; and 3) identification of the genetic changes that confer fosmidomycin resistance, by recapitulating candidate resistance mutations in sensitive wild-type parasite lines. This approach is innovative, since it uses genetic characterization of drug-resistant malaria parasites not only for drug target validation, but also o expand the fundamental biological understanding of an essential metabolic pathway. The proposed research is significant, because it will identify diagnostic biomarkers of fosmidomycin resistance, improve functional annotation of  hypothetical  genes in the P. falciparum genome, and identify new targets for much-needed antimalarial drug development.","6D"
2013,8422357,"1 R01 AI103338-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The design of better vaccines focuses on optimizing numbers, functional features and longevity of memory cells in vivo. Current research indicates that the achievement of such goals involves optimizing three distinct signals during vaccination, which are antigen presentation, co-stimulation and inflammation. The effective delivery of these signals during the priming of vaccine-induced immunity is usually associated with robust effector and memory lymphocyte responses, and the ability of memory T cells to efficiently re-expand upon secondary antigen encounter. In addition, maintenance of memory cells is dependent on homeostatic cytokines and expression of sufficient levels of the receptors for these cytokines. While unraveling the mechanisms of differentiation of T cells into potent memory cells is critical to improve vaccination strategies, an alternative possibility that has only been minimally explored is to develop methods to enhance the activation and expression of effector functions of vaccine-induced memory T cells at the time of infection. The success of such an approach requires a thorough understanding of how memory T cells undergo activation in vivo, which is a major goal of the current proposal. Over the past several years, we developed an experimental system to study the activation of memory CD8+ T cells in vivo in mice infected with the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). With this system, we established that memory CD8+ T cells with the capacity to protect against lethal infection secreted the proinflammatory chemokine CCL3/MIP1 upon recognition of their cognate antigen, a feature that was lacking in memory cells from non-protected animals. CCL3 secretion by protective memory CD8+ T cells promoted efficient recruitment and activation of phagocytes, specifically neutrophils and a distinct subset of monocytes known as  inflammatory monocytes , leading to microbial pathogens elimination. Most interestingly, our recent data show that the initial activation of memory CD8+ T cells in vivo is orchestrated by inflammatory monocytes and is independent of recognition of cognate antigen. Our working hypothesis postulates that inflammatory monocytes are central to optimal recall immune responses, both through activation of memory cells and for effective clearance of microbial pathogens. The current application proposes to investigate the molecular mechanisms that regulate memory CD8+ T cell activation in vivo and lead to enhanced pathogen killing. We will also assess such mechanism in models of inflammatory diseases such as type I diabetes. As specific aims for this proposal, we will establish (i) the contribution of cognate antigen recognition and inflammatory signals to memory CD8+ T cell activation in vivo, (ii) how inflammatory monocytes orchestrate the reactivation of memory CD8+ T cells and (iii) whether inflammatory monocytes contribute to memory CD8+ T cell-mediated autoimmunity. We anticipate the results of this work to lay the foundations for best design of future therapies modulating the reactivation of memory CD8+ T cells.","2C"
2013,8422783,"1 R01 AI103440-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The progression of acute and persistent viral infections is governed, in part, by the ability of CD4 and CD8 T cells to eliminate virus-infected cells or effectively retard viral replication. This is especially important for persistent viruses uch as HIV, CMV, or HCV that are never cleared by the immune system. This proposal describes experiments designed to understand a central control mechanism guiding T cell differentiation and function. Foxo transcription factors are differentially regulated by physiological conditions such as oxidative stress, abundance of growth factors (such as insulin), nutrient availability, or inflammation. Integrating this information, they promote or restrict programs of gene expression that govern cellular survival, quiescence, DNA repair, and metabolism, and they directly control highly specialized functions including: the IL-7 receptor, CTLA-4, and Icos. In particular, preliminary data presented demonstrate that Foxo transcription factors control the expansion and activation status of CD8 cytotoxic T cells post-infection. In addition, the absence of Foxo1 promotes the appearance of CD4 central memory precursor cells, and CD4 follicular helper cells able to produce IL-21. These results combined with the observation that HIV elite controller patients have a deficit in Foxo3 activity, reveal the central and profound influence that this transcription factor module exerts on the immune system. We propose an in depth analysis of Foxo1 and Foxo3 transcription factors in the progression and clearance of virus infections, and a large-scale analysis of their control over the programming of gene expression. The results will have direct implications for the progression of long co-evolved viral diseases such as HIV, Herpes, and Hepatitis C virus.","2C"
2013,8422897,"1 R01 DA034742-01","The main objective of this secondary data analysis project is to evaluate the impact of an innovative approach, Functional Family Therapy-Child Welfare (FFTCW), on the quality and costs of treatment and prevention services for substance abuse, HIV risk, delinquency, and other problem behaviors for youth and families in a child welfare setting. Child abuse and neglect are strong predictors of youth substance abuse, risky sexual behavior and conduct problems. Due to decreased funding and increased unemployment and poverty, child welfare agencies are being overwhelmed by the challenges of providing services to meet the substance abuse, HIV risk behaviors, and mental health needs of youth and families. As such, there is an urgent need to develop and test cost-efficient interventions for youth and families in child welfare settings. Research has provided support for the efficacy of family interventions for family conflict, adolescent substance use disorders, HIV-risk behaviors, and related problems. Most research has been conducted in juvenile justice or mental health settings, and there is little evidence that these interventions work in child welfare settings. The treatment costs associated with applying family interventions to all youth and families may prohibit their widespread utilization in community agencies. FFTCW was developed as a continuum of care model in which interventions are contingently applied based on the family¿s initial risk status. This innovative study capitalizes on significant work that has been done to develop and implement FFTCW in a real world setting; e.g., a full treatment manual and training protocol has been developed. Moreover, there is already preliminary evidence demonstrating the feasi-  bility, acceptability (to providers and families), and clinical outcomes for the model. All of the training and service activities pertaining to implementing FFTCW in 5 boroughs with approximately 3000 youth and families have been funded, almost exclusively by the Administration for Children¿s Services. A compari-son sample of 2000 families received services as usual (SAU) in the child welfare agency. As such, the results of this secondary analysis study would obviate the need for further treatment development of FFT (or similar family-models). FFTCW was developed with the support of a local agency and the child welfare system; the results of this study have immediate implications for the uptake and sustainability of FFTCW in real world settings. The aims of this study are: (1) To evaluate the cost and effectiveness of FFTCW compared to services as usual (SAU) in reducing adolescent substance use, HIV risk and other behavior problems, (2) To evaluate the cost and efficacy of FFTCW training on the rates of recurrent abuse, neglect, duration and out of home placement, and duration of child welfare service, and (3) To evaluate moderating and mediating effects of therapists/interventionists (fidelity), organizational (support), and family (co-occurring psychological problems) on substance abuse, HIV risk, and other problem behaviors.","5A"
2013,8422977,"5 R21 AI099007-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Innate host restriction barriers are major impediments to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in macaque species. However, the mechanisms of restriction remain incompletely understood. The goal of this application is to further characterize the replicative properties of macaque-tropic HIV-1 variants in vitro in order to gain a further understanding of adaptive viral mutations that may be important for escaping host restriction factors and establishing persistent infection and causing disease in the macaque host. We recently demonstrated that pig-tailed macaques are uniquely susceptible to HIV-1 infection because they do not express TRIM5?. Consequently, they can be persistently infected with a novel macaque-tropic HIV-1 clone that is chimeric for the SIV vif (HSIV-vif) and capable of counteracting the pig-tail restriction factors APOBEC3G and 3F. However, while infection by HSIV-vif is persistent for years, replication is very low compared to pathogenic SIV. Our preliminary data show that this may in part be due to the inability of the HIV- 1 strain used for the in vivo infection to escape the effects of type I interferon (IFN) induced innate restriction i pig-tail CD4+ T-cells. In preliminary studies, we have identified an HIV-1 clone that can escape type I interferon induced restriction in pig-tail CD4+ T-cells. We therefore hypothesize that HIV-1 variants may evolve that are capable of overcoming innate restriction in pig-tail CD4+ T-cells, leading to increased replication. The experiments proposed in this application will dissect the viral determinants that enable some variants of HIV-1 to persistently replicate in pig-tail CD4+ T-cells in a type I interferon-induced restrictive state. They will also further examine the cellular factors contributing to restriction. If successful, these studies should provide valuable insight ito HIV-1-host interactions influencing transmission and disease. Ultimately, the studies should inform the development of a macaque-model of HIV-1 pathogenesis.","2B"
2013,8423046,"5 R01 NS065785-06","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 replication is a combined result of host-virus interactions occurring at multiple steps of the virus life cycle including entry, gene expression, assembly, and budding. It is our long-term goal to understand regulation of HIV-1 gene expression and replication by host factors, thereby develop strategies for treating AIDS patients and ultimately preventing and eliminating HIV-1 infection. Unlike primary CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophages/momocytes, CD4- astrocytes are less susceptible to HIV-1 infection and do not support post- entry productive HIV-1 replication. Therefore, astrocytes have been regarded as an ideal natural platform to define the host factors that are essential for HIV-1 entry, gene expression and replication. Using a retrovirus- based expression cDNA library, we have revealed that HIV-1 gains access to astrocytes through human mannose receptor in a relatively inefficient CD4-independent and endocytosis-dependent manner. In addition, using the subtractive cloning strategy, we have identified Sam68 to be, at least in part, responsible for post- entry non-productive HIV-1 replication in astrocytes. The overall goal of this proposal is to characterize the molecular mechanisms of Sam68 function in HIV-1 replication in astrocytes as well as other HIV-1 natural target cells. This proposal is based on our three major findings (1) Sam68 is an essential cellular co-factor for HIV-1 Rev nuclear export; (2) Inhibition of HIV-1 replication by Sam68 mutants lacking a nuclear localization signal correlates with the cytoplasmic localization of constitutive Sam68; (3) Sam68 regulates translation of HIV-1 mRNAs in cytoplasm. The underlying hypothesis for this proposal is that Sam68 regulates HIV-1 replication at multiple steps of viral life cycle in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In other words, Sam68 is an important cellular co-factor for HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we propose three interrelated specific aims: (1) To determine the relationship between Sam68 expression and HIV-1 replication; (2) To characterize Sam68 function in HIV-1 Rev nuclear export; and (3) To define the cytoplasmic function of Sam68 in HIV-1 replication. We will use a variety of state-of-art biochemical, cellular, and molecular approaches throughout the studies. The answers sought have fundamental significance for understanding of this critical and pervasive protein Sam68 in HIV-1 replication. They should also aid in the development of anti- HIV therapeutic strategies.","2G"

2013,8423064,"5 R01 DA031201-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 Infection is associated with adverse outcomes in endocrine systems. Illicit drug abuse is a major risk factor for contracting HIV-1 infection and is also associated with abnormal endocrine outcomes. Several studies including ours have reported exacerbated endocrine abnormalities among drug abusing HIV-1+ individuals. But these investigations have been carried out among cocaine and/or opioids addicts, and the culture of drug abuse in the United States is changing. Methamphetamine (meth) is becoming a drug of choice all over the country and its abuse in South Florida particularly among MSM has skyrocketed. There is, however, a scarcity of investigations on the impact of methamphetamine on endocrines in HIV-1 infection. It is hypothesized that adrenal activity will be increased, there will be a hyper activity of thyroid as well as an increased incidence of insulin resistance, among HIV-1+ meth abusing MSM. In order to test these hypotheses, this 5 year application proposes to investigate cross sectionally adrenal, thyroid, and insulin activity in a total of 450 men in three groups: HIV-1+ meth abusers (n=150), HIV-1- meth abusers (n=150), HIV-1 - non-meth abusers (n=150) distributed among African Americans, Caucasians, and Hispanics. Because of the planned focus on MSM, only men will be included in the study. The following are aims: Aim 1: To investigate adrenal activity (ACTH and cortisol levels) as well as response to the combined dexamethasone-CRH challenge among meth abusing-HIV-1+ MSM, meth abusing HIV-1- MSM and HIV-1- meth-free control participants. Aim 2: To investigate thyroid activity (TSH, T4 and T3) as well as thyroid antibodies among meth abusing-HIV-1+ MSM, meth abusing HIV-1- MSM and HIV-1- meth-free control participants. Aim 3: To explore insulin activity among meth abusing-HIV-1+ MSM; meth abusing HIV-1- MSM and HIV-1- meth-free control participants.  These endocrine disturbances may lead to enormous burden of a number of serious medical consequences and outcomes in meth abusing MSM and further allow developing suitable interventions.","2E"
2013,8423066,"5 R01 MH093336-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a study to examine the HIV/AIDS risk behaviors of homeless youth in large interconnected networks of youth. The nearly 2 million runaway and homeless youth (RHY) in the United States each year are at great risk for contracting HIV/AIDS, with prevalence rates reported as high as 11.5%. To develop new interventions or improve existing network-based interventions, we must have an accurate assessment of network structure. The requisite data have not been collected because RHY are an unbounded population, and social network researchers have not reached consensus as to how to collect sociometric data from unbounded populations. The event-based approach (EBA) proposed by Freeman that samples the  regulars  of a socio-physical space (e.g. a beach) seems promising for RHY and will be tested in the proposed study. A broad spectrum of RHY (those in shelters and on the streets) can be found in large numbers, habitually accessing services from drop-in centers where they socialize, eat, and receive case management - they are  regulars  of a socio-physical space. These centers are also sustainable sites for future intervention delivery. Thus our Specific Aims are: 1. To use the event-based approach (EBA) to collect multiple panels of sociometric network data over time on an unbounded population of youth at risk for HIV/AIDS. 2. To examine how network positions relate to risk-taking and whether risk-taking structures endure over time, independent of the individual youth who may occupy those positions in the network. 3. To examine network ties to pro-social home-based peers and supportive family (including online, cell phone, and face to face connections) to explore sources of healthy influence and new points of intervention for youth who are not embedded in larger RHY networks. To accomplish these aims, we propose a three year study. RHY network data will be collected in two drop-in centers serving RHY in different neighborhoods in Los Angeles. We will collect four panels of sociometric data, once every 6 months at each location. Successfully addressing these aims will provide: (1) unique over time sociometric data on HIV risk in unbounded networks, (2) direction as to how to spend prevention dollars targeting RHY with face-to-face network interventions, and (3) new directions in HIV prevention interventions, using social networking technology to connect RHY to pro-social, non-RHY networks.","5B"
2013,8423080,"5 R01 AI035272-21","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of preventable death. The ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to remain latent in a nonreplicating drug resistant state in the host for decades, to be reactivated when the immunity of the person weakens, is a major impediment to curing and eradicating this disease that causes nearly two million deaths annually. Fatty acids are known to be the major energy source required for the persistence of Mtb in the host. However, the source of the fatty acids remains unknown. We postulate that Mtb stores energy as triacylglycerol (TG) and wax esters (WE) to successfully go through latency. The steps Mtb uses to store and mobilize these energy sources could be ideal targets for novel antilatency drugs that will eliminate latent Mtb. To elucidate these steps we propose to: (1) Generate gene-disrupted mutants for tgs, fcr, fabp, fatp, cut and lip genes that may encode enzymes that could be involved in the storage and mobilization of lipids for successfully going through latency. (2) Examine the biochemical functions of tgs, lip, cut, and fcr genes in Mtb a) Determine the effect of disruption of tgs, lip, cut and fcr genes in the accumulation of lipids in Mtb under stress conditions that induce a dormancy-like state b) Elucidate the possible role of the lip and cut mutants on the mobilization of the stored lipids c) Examine the possible role of tgs, lip and cut genes in acyl transfer reactions in Mtb lipid metabolism. (3) a) Utilize a novel in vitro multiple stress Mtb culture model of dormancy to identify the tgs and fcr genes involved in the accumulation of TG and WE during development of dormancy. b) Develop a method to use the multiple stress in vitro model to test antilatency drug candidates. (4) a) Test whether Mtb goes into a dormant state in THP-1 derived macrophages (TDM) under hypoxia b) Determine whether the lipid bodies that accumulate in Mtb within lipid-loaded TDM originate from host storage lipids and identify Mtb genes involved in lipid accumulation c) Determine whether the lipid body accumulation by Mtb in TDM is associated with development of Rif resistance by investigating whether mutants defective in lipid accumulation fail to develop Rif resistance. Gene-disrupted mutants that fail to manifest dormancy traits in both in vitro models of dormancy will be tested for their ability to successfully go through dormancy and reactivation in a rabbit containment/dexamethasone reactivation model of TB latency. They will also be submitted to TARGET for testing in a hollow fiber artificial granuloma model of dormancy in mice and determine whether storage lipid accumulation is involved in this in vivo dormancy model. (5) Gene-disrupted mutants that fail to manifest dormancy traits in both in vitro models of dormancy will be tested for their ability to successfully go through dormancy and reactivation in a rabbit containment/dexamethasone reactivation model of TB latency. They will also be submitted to TARGET for testing in a hollow fiber artificial granuloma model of dormancy in mice and determine whether storage lipid accumulation is involved in this in vivo dormancy model. The expected results are likely to help identify targets for novel drugs that can eliminate latent Mtb.","2D"
2013,8423271,"1 R21 AI103498-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a sterilizing vaccine against malaria. The specific hypothesis tested in this proposal is that sterilizing immunity against malaria can be achieved by induction of a lasting effector memory T cell (TEM) response targeting the liver stage of Plasmodium parasites. Repeated immunizations with live or irradiated sporozoites are known to protect vaccinated individuals against malaria challenge. Recent evidence suggests that this protection correlated with the presence of frequent pluripotent TEM, suggesting that permanent sterilizing immunity against malaria requires the induction of high levels of long-lived TEM by vaccination. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use recombinant cytomegalovirus (CMV) as a vaccine vector because CMV is the prototypical virus inducing long-lived TEM that do not show signs of T cell exhaustion. This unique capability of CMV-vectors was recently applied to induce long-lived TEM against simian immunodeficiency virus, resulting in protection against SIV-challenge that was by far superior to conventional heterologous prime/boost vaccines with respect to efficacy and duration. Since sterilizing protection against Plasmodium knowlesi parasites was only partial and shortlived when heterologous prime/boost vaccines were used, we will examine whether CMV-derived vaccine vectors will similarly confer lasting and efficacious immunity against challenge with Plasmodium knowlesi (Pk) sporozoites. We propose to generate recombinant RhCMV expressing four Pk antigens previously used for heterologous prime boost vaccination: the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the sporozoite surface protein 2 or thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (SSP2 or TRAP), the apical merozoite antigen-1 (AMA1) and the C-terminus of the merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1c). We will inoculate animals with this panel of four recombinant RhCMV/Pk vectors and monitor the development of TEM in blood, lung and liver. To determine whether the RhCMV/Pk4 vaccine is protective we will challenge with P. knowlesi sporozoites. Upon completion of this exploratory project, we will thus know whether a TEM-inducing vaccine can improve the level and duration of sterilizing immunity induced by subunit vaccines against malaria parasites.","6D"
2013,8423320,"5 R21 MH096631-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Universal HIV testing and immediate treatment of HIV-infected individuals could dramatically reduce the HIV epidemic, yet HIV testing uptake in sub-Saharan Africa remains low. In Tanzania, despite improved availability of HIV testing options, nearly two thirds of adults have never tested for HIV. Novel HIV testing options specifically designed to match the preferences of high-risk and hard-to-reach populations hold the potential to improve the acceptability and uptake of HIV testing.  To extend our previous work, which assessed uptake of HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) across varied venues in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania (free-standing, mobile, home-based, and clinic-based VCT), we propose to apply an innovative method for preference elicitation known as Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs, sometimes referred to as conjoint analysis) to HIV testing in this region. Grounded in the economic theory of utility maximization, the DCE method identifies key modifiable features of HIV testing options, presents survey respondents with various combinations of these features (each representing a hypothetical HIV testing option), and asks them to choose their preferred alternatives. Responses are analyzed to estimate the relative value placed on individual testing features, and to determine what combinations of features most influence decision-making and uptake.  The primary aims of this two-year study are to: 1) Use qualitative methods to identify key modifiable features of HIV testing programs that influence testing decisions; 2) Develop a DCE survey and elicit preferences from 800 randomly selected residents of the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania; and 3) Estimate preferences for existing as well as hypothetical, but feasible, HIV testing interventions. Differences in testig preferences between persons who have never tested for HIV and those who have previously tested for HIV will be described.  The study will be implemented in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania by a multidisciplinary research team that combines a track record of successful HIV testing research in Tanzania and experience with DCEs in diverse fields. The DCE method, applied in this context, holds promise to identify HIV testing preferences of hard-to-reach and at-risk populations for whom customized testing interventions can be devised. The data from this study will form the basis for implementation research on the benefits of tailoring HIV testing interventions to the specific preferences of the intended target populations. The effectiveness and cost- effectiveness of such interventions can subsequently be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.  Adapting available testing options to heterogeneous communities in sub-Saharan Africa has the potential to broadly improve the uptake of HIV testing, thereby bringing more persons living with HIV/AIDS into care and equipping persons living without HIV/AIDS with important information about HIV prevention.","5B"

2013,8423331,"5 R01 AI094563-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sexual transmission is the major cause of HIV infection in women. Both the World Health Organization and the National Institutes of Health have identified an urgent need for understanding heterosexual HIV transmission and the relevant physiology of the female reproductive tract (FRT) to support HIV prevention efforts. Because recent efforts to enhance mucosal defenses against STIs using topical microbicides have failed, a better understanding of FRT immunity is warranted. Despite knowledge of how FRT physiology changes in response to penile-vaginal intercourse (PVI), there is little understanding of how PVI affects HIV-relevant FRT immunity. Proposed experiments test effects of PVI on FRT immune mediators relevant to HIV infection. Given the acknowledged influence of sex hormones on HIV infection rates, these experiments also detail how PVI changes FRT immune mediators and sex steroids in parallel. The interdisciplinary research team is comprised of biomedical, sexual health, and HIV immune scientists and physicians. The proposed research includes three specific aims: (1) define effects of PVI on protein mediators of innate and adaptive immunity at the vaginal mucosa and systemic sex hormone concentrations; (2) determine effects of PVI on the capacity for vaginal fluids to influence the vulnerability of lymphocytes and macrophages to HIV infection in vitro; (3) characterize the influence of PVI on antimicrobial peptide (AMP) concentrations in vaginal fluid. Within-subject data will be obtained from 100 premenopausal adult women in long-term heterosexual relationships. Women will engage in PVI as the experimental condition, and four activities controlling for important elements of PVI (exercise, cuddling, self-stimulation, and quiet time) in their own homes, self-collecting FRT mucosal and salivary samples and completing self-report measures before, 15 minutes after, and the morning following each activity at times selected because of relevancy to vaginal microbicide applications. This repeated measures paradigm will examine whether FRT immunity is specifically modulated by PVI compared to four control activities of a social nature. FRT specimens will be used to quantify protein and lipid mediators, which reflect the state of mucosal immune defenses; salivary samples will be used to measure sex steroids. Results from the proposed research will shed new light on the basic biology of HIV-relevant immune function at the vaginal mucosa, to further understand the environment for sexual transmission of HIV, which the NIH has identified as critical to understanding HIV infection rates in women. Defining effects of PVI on immune defenses could have a major impact on the development of novel methods for the prevention or treatment of HIV. For example, identifying aspects of vaginal immunity that are dysregulated by sexual activity could inform the rational design of more effective microbicides.","3A"

The proposed studies will further define the molecular structure and replication properties of FIV with particular emphasis on defining targets for development of broad-based antivirals efficacious against both FIV and HIV. The proposed aims will continue ongoing studies to characterize receptor mechanisms shared with HIV and in addition, will utilize FIV-infected cat sera to assess the humoral antibody response to infection as a function of disease outcome. Aim 1 is directed at defining molecular interactions between the FIV envelope protein (SU) and the binding and entry receptors, CD134 and CXCR4, resp. Site-directed mutagenesis coupled with SU/receptor binding analyses by FACS and virus infectivity assays will be used to defined residues of SU critical for ligand/receptor interactions. [Sera from Progressor and Non-progressor cats will be analyzed against an overlapping peptide library to map epitopes recognized by infected cats as a function of disease progression]. Aim 2 will investigate the mechanism by which receptors are down-regulated on the infected cell by virus-encode OrfA and the consequences of down-regulation for both virus and host. Aim 3 will further investigate the role of novel anti-receptor antibodies from FIV-infected cats that block virus infection and are associated with improved health status of infected animals. Comparisons will be made between anti-receptor and anti-SU antibody titers for anti-viral activity in a large bank of naturally- and experimentally infected cats. Measurements of relative affinity and neutralization titers will be assessed as a function of health status of the infected cats. [In conjunction with Dr. VandeWoude at Colorado State University, we will create SU/receptor complexes and attempt to generate virus-blocking anti-receptor antibodies as found in Non-progressor FIV-infected cats. Such antibody responses may provide novel targets for vaccine development that may be applied to treatment/prevention of HIV infections in humans.]","2B,4A"
2013,8423360,"5 R01 AI041757-15","Project Summary/Abstract  The general transcription factor P-TEFb, consisting of Cdk9 and cyclin T, strongly stimulates RNA polymerase II elongation. It is also a host cell cofactor for Tat activation of HIV-1 transcription. Accumulating evidence suggests that Tat and the TAR RNA, located at the 5' end of all viral transcripts, not only recruit P-TEFb to the HIV-1 LTR but also cause the activation of Cdk9 kinase. For general transcription of cellular genes, data obtained during the current funding period indicate that P-TEFb is recruited to chromatin templates by the bromodomain protein Brd4. In addition, a major reservoir of nuclear P-TEFb is sequestered in the inactive 7SK snRNP. Further analyses indicate that in response to Ca2+-signaling, P-TEFb is released from 7SK snRNP upon the dephosphorylation of the conserved Cdk9 T-loop by PP1¿ and PP2B. The dephosphorylated P- TEFb is preferentially bound by Brd4, which recruits it to the transcription pre-initiation complex. As the phosphorylation of Cdk9 T-loop is essential for P-TEFb activity, the T-loop is expected to undergo rephosphorylation by an as yet unidentified Cdk activating kinase (CAK) at a later stage in order to restore full activity to P-TEFb. Given that P-TEFb is essential for productive HIV-1 infection, the objective of this proposal is to examine how the various modes of P-TEFb regulation exerted by its associated factors, a putative Cdk9-specific CAK and the HIV-1 Tat/TAR will impact HIV-1 transcription and replication. Proposed are experiments to investigate whether the expression and activity of various P-TEFb-associated factors can be manipulated to control HIV-1 replication and latency. A combination of targeted investigations and comprehensive, unbiased screens will be employed to identify the Cdk9-specific CAK and elucidate the mechanism and functional significance of its phosphorylation of P-TEFb. To determine the mechanism of Tat/TAR activation of P-TEFb, the impact of Tat/TAR on phosphorylation status of the Cdk9 T-loop at different stages of HIV-1 transcription, the possible existence of novel components within the Tat-TAR-P-TEFb complex, and the ability of TFIIH and TAF7 to inhibit P-TEFb activation will be examined. These experiments will offer an exciting opportunity to identify novel factors that contribute to the activation of P-TEFb and HIV-1 transcription and provide fresh insights into how P-TEFb stimulates transcription of both HIV-1 and cellular genes. A better understanding of the mechanism by which P-TEFb controls HIV-1 replication and latency and the versatility of Tat/TAR in modulating this process will be informative toward the identification of new targets for anti-HIV therapy.","2B"
2013,8423386,"5 R01 NS048837-10","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 associated dementia (HAD-now called HAND: HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder), is exacerbated by an imbalance between metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). As the TIMPs exhibit diverse non-classical functions including anti-apoptotic effects, the induction of TIMP-1 in neuroinflammatory conditions likely serves multiple roles in addition to modulating MMP activity. Our work in the previous funding cycle demonstrated that differential TIMP-1 expression in acute versus chronic activation of astrocytes and HAD brain tissues. We showed that in acute activation IL-12 upregulates TIMP-1 through multiple mechanisms, while chronic activation leads to TIMP-1 downregulation primarily through transcriptional control. We identified a novel CCAAT displacement protein (CDP) binding repressor element involved in astrocyte TIMP-1 regulation. Further, neurotoxicity assays were performed using staurosporine, macrophage-tropic HIV-1 virus and glutamate to induce cell death in cultured human neurons. In these assays, TIMP-1 had equivalent neuroprotective effects as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These neuroprotective effects were independent of MMP binding as shown with the TIMP-1 T2G mutant. Neurotrophic signaling through Bcl-2/Bcl-xL is a possible pathway for TIMP-1 neuroprotection and recently a tetraspanin has been identified as a potential TIMP-1 binding partner. Thus, the overarching hypothesis for this proposal is that astrocyte-TIMP-1 is differentially regulated in disease through CDP repression and contributes to loss of TIMP-1-mediated neuroprotection rendered via tetraspanin receptors on neurons. Furthermore, TIMP-1 CNS delivery strategies will be explored using novel nanomedicine approaches. Combined molecular, cellular, in vitro, in vivo and translational approaches will be used. In this competing renewal, we continue an in depth investigation into the mechanisms of astrocyte-TIMP-1 regulation via CDP, neuroprotective effects of TIMP-1 and explore a potential therapeutic nanomedicine strategy, based on our progress in the previous round of funding. We will first investigate the role of CDP in the regulation of astrocyte-TIMP-1 in HAD (Aim 1). Next, we will study the mechanisms of TIMP-1-mediated neuroprotection via tetraspanin signaling (Aim 2). Specifically, we will delineate the TIMP-1 neuronal tetraspanin receptors and related signal transduction mechanism leading to neuroprotection. Finally, we will explore the therapeutic application of GFAP-driven TIMP-1 expression using CNS-targeted nanoparticles (Aim 3). GFAP-TIMP- 1/luciferase constructs in Tat-conjugated PLGA nanoparticles will be intravenously administered to mice and CNS-specific TIMP-1 and luciferase expression will be evaluated. Thus, studies proposed in this renewal will unravel novel mechanisms underlying astrocyte responses during chronic neuroinflammation in HAD, have broader implications in other inflammatory diseases that involve MMP/TIMP imbalance and provide critical proof-of-concept data for future therapeutic strategies.","2G"

A growing body of research reveals that dating violence plays a significant role in adolescent girls' HIV risk. DV has been associated with less condom use, younger age at first intercourse, having multiple sex partners and alcohol use prior to sexual encounters. Thus, prevention strategies that address dating violence and HIV risk may hold promise for reducing sexual risk behavior among a particularly at-risk population. In this proposed research plan, a cognitive-behaviorally based intervention to be named  Skills to Manage Aggression in Relationships for Teens  (SMART) will be developed and tested. The program will be implemented with a sample of underserved youth, as economic disadvantage and minority status have been found to be related to increased rates of adolescent dating violence. A primary focus of the intervention will be to address mental health problems (i.e. psychological distress and behavioral dysregulation) that underlie the development and maintenance of both dating violence and sexual risk behavior among adolescent girls. Dr. Rizzo's training goals are to (1) increase her expertise in conducting preventive interventions for HIV, (2) receive intensive clinical and research training in adolescent HIV risk, (3) acquire expertise in conducting research with, and providing clinical treatment for, adolescent girls exposed to dating violence, (4) advance her skills in intervention research with ethnic minority and economically disadvantaged populations, (5) develop R01 -level skills in prevention research methodology and statistics and (6) receive mentorship regarding professional development issues. These training goals will be achieved through a combination of formal coursework and seminars, focused clinical and research experiences, and ongoing close research supervision by members of the mentorship team. The training plan of this K-Award will provide the opportunities needed to research the effects of a preventive intervention for a vulnerable group of young women.","5A"
2013,8423400,"5 R01 DK078900-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rho kinase (ROCK) is a serine/threonine protein kinase which functions as one of the downstream effectors for the small G-protein RhoA. The RhoA/ROCK pathway has an important role in mediating various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal remodeling, cell proliferation, and gene expression. More recently, the RhoA/ROCK pathway has emerged as a promising target in the treatment of coronary vasospasm, stroke, erectile dysfunction, and hypertension. In this proposal, we argue that ROCK also plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) via its involvement in modulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway. Our hypothesis is based on several novel observations: 1) RhoA/ROCK pathway is involved in glucose-induced signaling (Danesh FR et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002), 2) Blockade of ROCK ameliorates progression of DN in the db/db model of type 2 diabetes (Kolavennu V et al. Diabetes 2007), and 3) our preliminary data suggesting that ROCK activation plays a pivotal role in both mitochondrial and NADPH redox signaling. Based upon these initial observations, we now propose an integrated in vitro and in vivo approach to test three specific aims. Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that at the cellular level, ROCK mediates the cross-talk between mitochondrial- and NADPH-derived ROS overproduction in the diabetic milieu. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that selective inhibition of ROCK in the experimental models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes ameliorates the progression of DN by inhibiting ROCK-mediated ROS production. Aim 3: To test the effect of tissue-specific conditional gene targeting of ROCK in DN. The findings of this application will provide a significant advance in three aspects: first, the successful completion of this proposal is not only relevant to kidney research, but it will also provide a framework for understanding the spatial and temporal behavior of redox signaling. Second, it will assess the role of RhoA/ROCK signaling in the kidney. And third, it will lead to development of novel therapeutic strategies in DN.","2G"

The ultimate goal is to use the experimentally determined structure to carry out drug discovery aimed at inhibiting HIV cell entry using structure-based drug design (SBDD) approaches. CCR5 is the primary co-receptor responsible for HIV transmission, while emergence of CXCR4-tropic (X4-tropic) viruses later in infection correlates with a more rapid CD4 decline and a faster progression to AIDS. As the predominant co-receptor for HIV entry, CCR5 has long been taken as one of the most important drug targets. Five CCR5 targeted drugs to date have been brought to clinical trial, but only one, Maraviroc, has been approved by FDA. Molecular details of how this drug as well as other CCR5 cell entry inhibitors works are not understood and will be a focus of the proposed study. The proposed structural studies will be carried out using methods and approaches of the Gene-to-Structure-Pipeline that was developed by the GPCR Network. The specific aims are: 1) Optimize the CCR5 construct design to generate large samples of highly purified and thermally stabilized CCR5 for biophysical and functional studies; 2) Design and synthesize chemical tools that can be used to stabilize CCR5 and to probe ligand-receptor interactions; 3) Develop an understanding of CCR5 ligand binding properties by determining the 3D structures of several complexes. It is expected that structural knowledge generated by our studies will lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies and help in stopping the growth of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China and elsewhere in the world.","2A"

My immediate goals/training needs are: 1) to develop my understanding of aging and geriatric syndromes, falls in particular; 2) to develop more advanced skills in information extraction and statistical analysi; 3) to gain experience in qualitative methods; and 4) To develop skills in clinical intervention research. My long-term goals are: 1) to be an independent and productive investigator in the field of geriatric syndromes and HIV, with particular expertise in falls and the use of electronic medical record-based observational cohorts; 2) to develop a falls assessment and prevention intervention tailored to the HIV infected populations; and 3) to use this approach to explore other geriatric syndromes in the context of HIV infection. This project brings together mentors from multiple disciplines who are committed to my development as an independent researcher. The goal-directed training activities address my immediate goals/training needs and include didactics, intensive workshops, ongoing participation in seminars, particularly in aging and biostatistics, work on the research project itself, and preparation of an R03 that will launch the next step in my career. Environment: The facilities and resources provided by Yale and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Connecticut are unparalleled. The Yale School of Nursing provides extensive support to faculty conducting clinical research. The Yale Center for Medical Informatics supports resources for training and research in informatics, particularly in the area o information extraction. Much of the work that informs our understanding of falls in the elderly and falls prevention interventions comes from the Yale Program on Aging. This cross- disciplinary program provides extensive educational opportunities as well as access to individuals from a broad range of disciplines who incorporate aging as a focus of their clinical and research work. The VHA Connecticut is the home of the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) which provides the data for this project and has extensive computer resources that make the exploration of large datasets, such as VACS, feasible. Research: The research will explore serious falls (SF), falls that are serious enough to merit a visit to a health care provide, among HIV infected and uninfected individuals aged > 40 years. There is evidence that falls are a problem among HIV infected individuals. However, the differences that exist between this population and the general elderly population highlight the inappropriateness of simply imposing falls prevention interventions that work in the elderly on HIV infected individuals. Orthostasis and vision loss are common in the elderly, but are not central health concerns for HIV infected individuals. HIV specific factors such as lower CD4 count, higher viral load, efavirenz use, and ritonavir use may also contribute to falls risk. I propose the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence, frequency, sequelae, and age of onset of SF; 2) To elucidate traditional and HIV-specific risk factors for SF; 3) In HIV infected individuals who have had a serious fall, to describe the factors that contributed to the fall, as well as their risk for a subsequent fall. In SA1, there are three dependent variables: first serious fall (SF), recurrent SFs, and serious fall sequelae. Serious falls will be identified using falls-related E-codes. In addition, I will use information extraction to identify serious falls in radiology reports and in outpatient progress notes. HIV status is the primary predictor variable. Sequelae of SFs will be identified by diagnostic codes. The independent variable is HIV status. I will use Poisson regression, piecewise logistic regression, and Cox regression models to test the hypotheses. In SA2, serious falls are the primary outcome and will be identified as in SA1. The primary independent variable is HIV status. In the first model that will combine HIV infected and uninfected Veterans, I will explore the contribution of traditional risk factors to the risk of a serious fall. I will test whether polysubstance abuse has a greater association with SF in HIV infected individuals by inclusion of an interaction between polysubstance abuse and HIV status and include traditional RFs. In a separate model restricted to HIV infected individuals, I will tes the contribution of HIV specific risk factors, particularly CD4 count and efavirenz use, in additio to traditional risk factors, to the risk of serious falls. I will use a longitudinal piecewise logitic regression and estimate the longitudinal average attributable fraction of each RF. SA3 will be explored from a sample of locally recruited HIV infected patients with a history of a serious fall. This is a qualitative aim that will use semi-structured, face-to-face interviews. An interpretive descriptive approach will guide data analysis. Data collected from the electronic medical record will provide specific information about the participants' medical history and about the evaluation of the fall in the emergency room or in the clinic. Together, these aims will provide me with the information necessary to develop a falls prevention intervention that is tailored to the specific risks encountered by HIV infected individuals and to begin to build a career in geriatric syndromes in the context of HIV infection.","5B,7A"

The relative contributions of stochastic (random) selection vs. active selection by specific viral and host characteristics to this bottleneck are unclear. Mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission (MTCT) through breastfeeding, in which transmission pairs and timing of infant infection are readily identified, provides an instructive model to address these important and unresolved questions. We will use serial samples from a large, well characterized cohort of HIV-1 infected Zimbabwean women who transmitted HIV-1 through breastmilk. This cohort includes women with chronic HIV-1 infection (CI; N=35), and women who acquired primary HIV-1 infection post-partum (acute infection, AI; N=13). We combine phylogenetics (with frequency analyses based on deep sequencing data) with functional assays (CD4 and co-receptor use, entry kinetics, neutralization sensitivity), to quantitatively and comprehensively analyze the relationship of founder viruses to maternal blood or breastmilk variants, quantify the relative contributions of stochastic vs. active selectio, identify selection pressures on envelope (env), differentiate when selection pressures may operate during the transmission bottleneck, and determine whether founder env variants are better adapted than other non- transmitted variants for postnatal MTCT. Delineation of the biologic properties of transmitted variants along with mapping the genetic bases of these biologic properties, should improve understanding of HIV-1 entry and the mechanisms of action of HIV-1 entry inhibitors. These studies will also improve our understanding of the in vivo selective pressures exerted by autologous neutralizing antibodies and innate factors in two distinct and relevant anatomic compartments (blood, where levels of antibodies are high, and breastmilk, where they are much lower) and the potential role of neutralization sensitivity or escape in transmission. Finally, these studies will specifically reveal whether increasing the neutralizing activity of blood or breastmilk (e.g., through passive or active immunization) or targeting other Env functional properties (tropism, infectivity) hold promise to block primary infection of women and children.","1A"
2013,8423678,"5 R21 AI094338-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB) is a treatable infectious disease, however, the lack of efficient diagnostic tests are important bottleneck impeding access to treatment. Thus, simple, sensitive and specific diagnostic approaches are desperately needed. An antigen detection assay for TB is uniquely attractive because tests can be performed using a variety of patient specimens. The urine lipoarabinomannan- enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (LAM-ELISA) detections are attractive, especially for the patients with HIV infection, unfortunately, the sensitivity of these assays is low, which makes this test suboptimal. The question we ask is why the sensitivity of LAM-ELISA detection is inefficient? LAM from Mtb grown in vivo may have a structure quite unique and distinct from its in vitro counterpart and it could have distinct modifications such as succinylation, mannosylation and substitution with methythioxylofuranose which will lend credence to its sensitivity. If so, it will explain the failure in reaction with antibodies included in the commercial kits to capture LAM in biofluid as all are raised against in vitro grown Mtb or LAM isolated from Mtb grown in vitro. Thus in this proposal we propose to exploit our unique ability to extract LAM from lung, granulomas, liver and kidneys from experimentally infected guinea pigs with different clinical strains, and to define the nonreducing end exhaustively focusing on the terminal residue modifications since they are the epitopes for the anti-LAM antibodies recognition. Initial proof of concept experiments has shown that the yield of LAM in vivo will not be sufficient for the structural analysis using the methods for the structural analysis on LAM from the in vitro grown bacilli. Therefore, our structural studies will rely heavily on use of more sensitive tests such as Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), enzyme digestion, and mapping of the oligosaccharides with Electrospray Ionization. As a fingerprint, in vitro grown bacilli from clinical isolates with definite phenotype will be included in the protocol. The definition of the terminal ends of LAM in vivo will impact the future when a sensitive and specific anti-LAM antibody can be generated based on this study to enhance LAM based existing assays for use in resource poor regions.","6D"
2013,8423679,"5 R21 AI095795-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In vitro detection of anti-TB liver metabolites in early drug discovery Abstract Current algorithms for high throughput screening-based drug discovery for antimicrobial agents, including those for tuberculosis, fail to account for the possibility of active metabolites early in the drug discovery process. Compounds that would only be active after metabolism in the liver (prodrugs) are not detected in high throughput screens. Similarly, compounds that are found to be metabolically unstable by LC-MS during in vitro ADME evaluation are not progressed to in vivo evaluation on the assumption that metabolites will be inactive (type 2 compounds). Proving that assumption would require identification of the metabolite structure, synthesis and testing the metabolite directly. This is too time and labor intensive at the hit to lead stage. We will establish in vitro assays to rapidly detect the anti-tuberculosis (TB) activity of liver enzyme-derived metabolites. These TB-active metabolite assays (TAMA) should obviate the need for metabolite ID and synthesis to confirm the presence or absence of an active metabolite. We will combine liver enzyme metabolite generation systems (MGS) with rapid anti-TB assays. Enzymatic MGS includes liver microsomes, S9 fractions, recombinant CYP450 enzymes and combinations of these systems and can be used in a one-pot assay. Preliminary data suggests enzymatic MGS are compatible with M. tuberculosis growth and rapid viability assessment by fluorometric determination of Alamar Blue reduction or luminescent intracellular ATP measurement. HepaRG and MCL-5 cell supernatants will also be assessed as MGS. To distinguish active metabolites of active parent compounds (type 3) from metabolically stable, active parent compounds (type 1) concurrent LC-MS analysis of parent compound stability will be performed and analyzed together with the TAMA data. An optimized TAMA will be used in a HTS of 100K compounds to identify prodrugs and potential type 3 compounds. Determination of stability of all hits by LC-MS and subsequent data analysis will differentiate type 3 from type 1 compounds. Selected metabolites will be identified by LC-MS/MS and NMR, synthesized and evaluated directly against M. tuberculosis as proof of concept. The MGS can increase compound library diversity and give consideration to revisiting previously screened libraries. The ability to detect active metabolites by this method early in the drug discovery process will allow for the further progression of some active (type 3) compounds with poor metabolic stability that otherwise would be deprioritized using only LC-MS based stability assays.","6D"

CNICS is a large and diverse consortium of cohort studies of over 22,000 HIV infected patients receiving ongoing primary HIV care in a clinic setting after 1 January 1995. Selected sites for the proposed work include the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research HIV Clinical Cohort (J. Eron, PI), the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) 1917 Clinic Cohort (M. Saag, PI), and the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Practice Cohort (R. Moore, PI). The proposed study aims to (1) examine whether availability and use of ancillary services (i.e., case management, alcohol and drug abuse treatment) is associated independently with a lower risk of subsequent HIV virologic failure and assess whether this association is mediated by scheduled appointment attendance; (2) examine whether competing needs (i.e., forgoing medical care due to work or limited funds) are associated independently with an increased risk of subsequent HIV virologic failure and assess whether this association is mediated by scheduled appointment attendance; and (3) examine whether dissatisfaction with the healthcare provider-patient relationship is associated independently with an increased risk of subsequent HIV virologic failure and assess whether this association is mediated by scheduled appointment attendance. For all three aims, marginal structural modified Poisson regression models will be used to estimate total, natural direct, and natural indirect effects of ancillary HIV services, competing needs, and healthcare provider-patient relationships on virologic failure. Indirect effects mediated through scheduled appointment attendance will specifically be explored. Results from the proposed work will identify barriers to care among HIV-infected AAs and inform implementation of targeted interventions at the patient and contextual (e.g., clinic, neighborhood, policy) level to minimize such barriers. Minimizing barriers to care among AAs will in turn reduce substantial and longstanding racial disparities in HIV disease.","1B"

However, in order to derive information from these rich stores of data we need to develop sound and appropriate analytic techniques. This need is especially relevant in studies at the intersection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are characterized by an elaborate set of interactions among viral and host factors. These factors include viral and host genetic profiles, as well as markers of caloric metabolism, immune activation and inflammation, which work together to determine response to therapy and overall disease progression. A comprehensive assessment of these markers presents several analytical challenges owing to the large number of potentially informative variables and the largely uncharacterized relationship among them. We propose a multi-faceted strategy that focuses on the development and application of integrative statistical approaches. Such approaches will allow us to explore and characterize novel hypotheses relating to the complex relationships among multiple genetic, environmental, demographic, and clinical factors and measures of disease progression. Specifically, this continuation application focuses on advancing and applying statistical methods in two settings: first, we consider population-based genetic association studies of innate-immunity, adipokine, drug metabolism and drug transport genes and markers of immune reconstitution, inflammation and risk of CVD in HIV-infected individuals; and second, we address investigations of metabolic and immunologic profiles that associate with immune recovery, inflammation and risk of CVD. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate: (1) Latent class and mixture modeling paradigms for (a) discovering and characterizing multi-locus genotype-trait associations and (b) evaluating unobservable haplotype-trait associations in candidate-gene investigations; and (2) Hierarchical mixture models and machine learning approaches for (a) monitoring quantitative biomarkers in resource-limited settings and (b) characterizing high- dimensional predictors of immune reconstitution and inflammation.

It is the overall goal of this proposal to elucidate the role of the sporozoite's major surface protein, the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) in this journey. We have been studying the proteolytic processing of CSP and thus far, have found that processing occurs when sporozoites contact hepatocytes and is required for efficient invasion. Specifically, our data indicate that the amino-terminus of CSP masks the cell-adhesive domain in the carboxy-terminus and that proteolytic cleavage results in removal of the amino-terminus and exposure of this cell-adhesive domain. Overall our data suggest that CSP has two functional domains, each with distinct role(s) during the sporozoite's journey. The goal of this proposal is to continue our structure-function work on this important protein to define the role of each CSP domain in the mammalian host and to identify the protease responsible for CSP cleavage. The specific aims are: 1) To elucidate the phenotype of sporozoite mutants which expressed only the cleaved form of CSP in the dermis of the mammalian host. Using quantitative PCR, transcriptional profiling and confocal microscopy, we will determine whether N-terminal deletion mutants remain in the skin and begin their development there. 2) To determine the binding properties of each CSP domain by generating mutants in N-terminal residues that we have identified as having potential heparin-binding activity and using biochemical techniques to determine the binding partner of the TSR domain. 3) To identify the protease that cleaves CSP and determine its subcellular location in the sporozoite. These studies will be performed using conditional mutagenesis to delete candidate protease genes and using antisera to localize the proteases in sporozoites. Overall these studies will elucidate how CSP functions in the sporozoite¿s journey from mosquito to mammalian host and should open up new avenues for the control and prevention of malaria.","2D"

Syphilis also is a paradigm of bacterial chronicity and immune evasion, but virtually nothing is known about how T. pallidum carries out these enigmatic processes. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of information on the functions of T. pallidum membrane proteins that likely contribute to the spirochete's complex parasitic strategy. T. pallidum is postulated to encode 45 membrane lipoproteins (4.3% of its genome). Membrane lipoproteins typically serve many important physiological roles and also have significance as virulence factors, modular components of ABC-type transporters, stabilizers of membrane integrity, protective immune targets, and proinflammatory agonists. However, the functions of the treponemal lipoproteins have remained largely undefined. In a departure from traditional T. pallidum research, we have been crystallizing the membrane lipoproteins of T. pallidum and inferring their functions from structural determinations. State-of-the-art biophysical and biochemical techniques are being applied to corroborate functions derived from structural data. From significant progress made over the past funding interval in solving the three-dimensional structures of five T. pallidum lipoproteins (Tp32, TP0319 [TmpC; PnrA], Tp34, TP0655 [PotD], and Tp0956), it is now well documented that our structural biology approach represents a successful discovery platform for exploring lipoprotein functions in the context of T. pallidum's atypical membrane biology (a key aspect of treponemal pathogenesis). Furthermore, from prior progress, we are now able to propose hypothesis-driven experiments that will allow us to place our lipoprotein functional assignments better in the context of T. pallidum physiology and membrane biology. Given this, the Specific Aims of this renewal proposal are (1) To assess the levels of expression and membrane surface localization in T. pallidum of lipoproteins whose functions are being determined; (2) To continue to clone, express in E. coli, purify, and crystallize recombinant T. pallidum lipoproteins, with emphasis on solving their three-dimensional structures. Structural data then will be used to formulate new testable hypotheses regarding potential protein function(s); and (3) To conduct follow-up biological, biochemical, and biophysical experiments that will complement functional predictions and place them in the context of T. pallidum biology and syphilis pathogenesis. Clarifying the functions of the membrane lipoproteins is essential for understanding many of the unusual aspects of T. pallidum membrane biology and its relationship to syphilis pathogenesis.","2D"

The analysis of Tregs in HIV patients is complicated due to lack of specific markers. It is also still not clear whether Treg cell loss contributes to inflammation during HIV infection or whether they are detrimental by suppressing HIV-specific immune responses. During the previous grant period we made major advances in understanding Treg cell differentiation and established methods to expand them in vitro. We discovered a cell surface molecule, called GARP, highly specifically expressed on bona fide activated Tregs. We also found that receptors for proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF and their respective decoys are preferentially expressed on human Treg cells. Additionally, we developed a novel technology to expand and genetically engineer Tregs with HIV-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) to determine the role of TCR signals in their suppressive function. In this proposal we aim to use these innovative tools and technical advances to: (1) Determine association of Tregs with immune activation status of HIV-infected individuals either with or without treatment in a prospective study; (2) Determine the function of Tregs in sensing and suppressing inflammation and whether this function is compromised during HIV infection; (3) Determine the specificity and suppressive role of Tregs in manipulating HIV-specific immune responses; and (4) Develop an experimental framework to decode the role of peptide affinity and concentrations in regulating Treg responses through TCR signaling. Together, these new approaches will have wide range of implications for using bona fide Tregs as biomarkers during HIV infection, defining their role in immune activation and in suppressing HIV-specific immune responses during HIV infection. This knowledge can also be exploited to design more potent HIV vaccines.","2B"
2013,8423801,"5 R01 DA026312-04","Abstract  Over 25 million people have died of AIDS, making it one of the largest public health crises in history. There are over 33 million people with HIV world-wide. The majority of new HIV cases occur before age 25, and within marginalized populations.  Syndemics  theory postulates that multiple emerging and converging psychosocial epidemics are the driving mechanisms that cause HIV transmission. We are proposing that a developmental interpretation and application of syndemics theory is needed in order to explain HIV risk. Sexual minority youth (youth who endorse some level of same-sex attraction, behavior, and/or identity) are an ideal population to use as a model for testing the longitudinal development of syndemic processes. Sexual minority youth are highly marginalized, poorly understood, and severely underserved. They experience multiple psychosocial problems of epidemic proportions that are considered the core components of the syndemic effect. Compared with heterosexual youth, sexual minority youth are up to 5 times more likely to use drugs, 7 times more likely to be victimized, 6 times more likely to have mental health problems, and 5 times more likely to engage in HIV risk behavior. Yet longitudinal studies with sexual minority youth have rarely been conducted due to a host of cultural and methodological barriers. The overarching goal of this research project is to examine substance use and HIV risk behaviors in a longitudinal study of sexual minority youth and a matched comparison group of heterosexual youth. Due to the many important features of the proposed methodology and theory, this will be the first youth study of its kind. These features include the: (A) longitudinal, quasi-experimental design, (B) evaluation of individual growth or change in adolescent substance use and risky sexual behaviors over time, (C) examination of mediators and moderators of risk for substance use and risky sexual behavior, and (D) identification of risk and protective factors associated with the convergence of these multiple emerging epidemics and how they lead to HIV/AIDS. Results from this project will generate a wealth of information about the development of health problems among this highly vulnerable and marginalized group. They will provide empirical support for a developmental interpretation and application of the syndemics framework. And they will serve as a model for understanding how syndemic processes unfold in marginalized populations to raise risk for HIV/AIDS.","5B"
2013,8423805,"5 R01 AI059621-10","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The earliest described progenitors in the adult mouse thymus are termed early thymic progenitors (ETPs). They derive from rare circulating hematopoietic progenitors, whose identity was previously unknown. Our work in the previous funding period established that a population of progenitors termed early lymphoid progenitors (ELPs) circulates, and physiologically settles the thymus. In our current proposal, we wish to understand how rare ELPs settling the thymus give rise to ETPs and other downstream populations from which mature, immunocompetent T cells are ultimately derived. We hypothesize that tremendous proliferation occurs right after thymic settling, by which rare ELPs that settle the thymus generate large numbers of early thymic progenitors (ETPs). Indeed, we think that more proliferation may occur immediately after thymic settling than at any subsequent stage of T lymphopoiesis. One goal of our current proposal is to quantify this proliferation, and to determine how it is regulated. As ELPs settling the thymus possess lineage potentials for multiple cell types, another goal is to address the question of how alternative lineage fates and in particular the myeloid fate are constrained after thymic settling. Notch is a cell surface receptor involved in multiple cell fate decisions, and we wish to probe the role of Notch signaling in these critical early events. Further, we wish to determine the molecular mechanisms by which Notch co-ordinates T lineage commitment and lineage progression. Together, these studies will allow us to piece together a lineage of cells that extends from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow to ETPs within the thymus, and to understand the signals that guide cells down the T cell developmental pathway. Our specific Aims are: Specific Aim 1: To measure proliferation between thymic settling and the generation of ETPs. Specific Aim 2: To determine the function of Notch signaling in ETPs. Specific Aim 3: To determine the mechanism by which Notch signals result in T lineage progression and commitment.","2C"
2013,8423813,"5 R01 AI064046-08","DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): The discovery of the anti-viral APOBEC3 proteins is regarded as one of the most therapeutically promising breakthroughs in HIV/AIDS molecular virology in recent years. HIV pathogenesis depends on its accessory protein Vif, which functions to counteract the APOBEC3 proteins and trigger their degradation. Five APOBEC3 proteins are susceptible to Vif-mediated degradation, and all seven APOBEC3 proteins have been reported to be capable of individually suppressing the replication of Vif-deficient HIV. Given the additional capacity of these proteins to homo- and hetero-oligomerize, it is further possible that the APOBEC3 proteins form a combinatorial restriction network with a broader range of anti-viral activities exceeding those of individual proteins. Thus, this application has three major aims, each testing an innovative hypothesis that will positively impact the present state of the field. First, we will test the hypothesis that at least two of the understudied APOBEC3s contribute to HIV restriction in vivo. A combination of methods will be used to identify the minimal set of APOBEC3s required for restriction in non-permissive T-cell lines and pathogenesis-relevant primary CD4+ T lymphocytes including gene targeting, short hairpin RNA knock-downs, differentially APOBEC3-susceptible virus isolates, and novel APOBEC3 inhibitor compounds. We anticipate that these studies will enable us to show definitively which APOBEC3s contribute to HIV restriction. Second, we will directly test a combinatorial restriction hypothesis through systematic APOBEC3 co-expression, co- immunoprecipitation, co-encapsidation, single cycle, and spreading infection experiments. Third, we will use APOBEC3-null T-cell lines and DNA deaminase inhibitors as tools to quantify the contribution of the endogenous APOBEC3 proteins to the HIV mutation rate and spectrum. These studies are anticipated to have important implications for understanding virus evolution, immune evasion, and drug resistance. Taken together, this new knowledge will advance our fundamental understanding of the HIV-relevant human APOBEC3 repertoire and, importantly, help prioritize ongoing and future efforts to develop novel HIV/AIDS therapeutics that work by modulating this network.","2B"

2013,8424200,"5 R01 AI097242-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection afflicts approximately 170 million people worldwide and chronic virus replication in these individuals is a significant cause of liver inflammation, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and a host of extra-hepatic disease states. No vaccine exists to prevent transmission of this blood borne pathogen, and the current non-specific drug therapy used to treat patients is of limited efficacy for the mos common HCV genotypes. Although progress has been made in the last decade in the development of specific small molecule inhibitors targeting a number of viral proteins, the error prone nature of HCV RNA replication suggests resistance to these inhibitors will develop. A cocktail-based therapeutic approach using multiple specific inhibitors targeting distinct aspects of the HCV life cycle is therefore a prudent strategy for future therapeutics, and this approach requires the development of numerous specific inhibitors with unique mechanisms of action. Despite an essential role in the virus life cycle, the viral NS2 protease has seen surprisingly litle activity as an anti-viral target. NS2 is a papain-like cysteine protease that catalyzes the auto-catalytic cleavage of the NS2/NS3 junction in the viral polyprotein, and this cleavage is essential for productive infections. Using a series of engineered autonomously replicating HCV replicons, we have developed a potential screen to identify compounds that disrupt viral replication in a manner dependent on NS2 activity. Although preliminary results suggest the large format version of this assay can identify NS2 inhibitors, considerable effort will be required before this assay can be moved into a high content screening environment. This application is directed towards announcement PA-10-213, a program specifically geared towards assay development for eventual access to the NIH MLPCN screening center program. The overall goal of this proposed project is to develop our assay for NS2 function into an assay appropriate for high throughput small molecule screening and develop appropriate counter and secondary screens to maximize the impact of future screening efforts. To this end we have proposed a series of logical experiments in three specific aims to miniaturize and validate our assay, develop appropriate counter screens that fit into a logical compound triaging plan, and provide a context in which tool compounds that result from our screen might be used to understand HCV biology.","6D"
2013,8424201,"5 R21 AI100280-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are over 300 million clinical episodes of malaria each year worldwide with over 1 million deaths, primarily in children under 5. Over 41% of the world's population lives in areas where malaria is transmitted. The global economic toll of malaria is staggering. In addition to contributing significantly towards overall childhood mortalit in the poorest nations, the disease is estimated to cause approximately a 1.3% reduction in economic growth in countries that bear a heavy malaria burden. Unfortunately, most of the drugs that are currently being used for malaria treatment were developed more than 30 years ago and many are derivatives of older drugs. In the absence of a large-scale effort to develop novel drugs against malaria, most antimalarials have now become ineffective due to widespread drug resistance. Investment in the discovery of new therapeutics for the treatment of malaria has been sparse and the number of new treatments introduced to the market is correspondingly low. Given the global toll of malaria and the spread of drug resistance, it is important to identif new chemical entities that can be developed into therapeutics for the treatment of drug-resistant malaria. The proposed research project seeks to discover novel chemical entities from marine microbes targeting the malaria parasite is timely and will provide entry into novel therapeutic interventions for the disease. Our approach will be to tap into the chemical and biological diversity of the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute Marine Microbial Culture Collection (HBMMCC) as a source of novel bioactive natural products. We will assay a novel library of marine microbe derived extracts for their ability to inhibit the growth of the malaria parasite usig the SYBR Green I Fluorescent assay. Active extracts will be dereplicated using Liquid-chromatography- mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) and NMR methodologies and those with the greatest potential for novel chemistry will be further profiled for their activity against a panel f drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains to define potency, and the mammalian cell lines to help assess therapeutic index. Extracts with strong potency against the malaria parasite, low toxicity to mammalian cells and novel chemistry will be taken through bioassay- guided fractionation to identify the structure of bioactive components. The proposed research is significant because at the end of this project we expect to have a portfolio of antimalarial  hits","6D"
2013,8424209,"5 R21 AI100718-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this pilot proposal, we will address the hypothesis that CD200 and CD200R are dysregulated in HIV infected individuals.  CD200 and CD200R form a critical pathway by which monocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cell function can be regulated by T cells.  Triggering of this pathway has been shown to directly suppress monocyte and macrophage activation, which in turn reduces T cell activation.  In Aim 1 of this proposal we will perform the initial studies to characterize the expression of CD200 on T cells and its relatio to chronic immune activation in HIV infected individuals from various stages of infection.  In Aim 2 we will examine expression of the receptor for CD200, CD200R, on cells of the myeloid lineage in HIV infected individuals.  We will also examine the relationship between CD200R expression on myeloid lineage cells and chronic activation markers on T cells, as well as lipopolysaccharide levels in the plasma.  Altered regulation of either CD200 or CD200R (or both) in HIV infected individuals could directly influence chronic immune activation, so it is important to assess each part of the pathway.  If successful, these results will pave the way to future studies designed to directly study the mechanistic effects of the CD200/CD200R pathway on chronic immune activation, as well as a means to either abrogate or promote CD200R signaling as a therapeutic strategy.","2C"

2013,8424220,"5 R21 AI098039-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bacterial virulence factors directly mediate host-pathogen interactions, thus providing tools to probe virulence mechanisms and to identify key host immune functions. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is able to survive intracellularly through extensive manipulation of the host. Mtb produces two secreted virulence factor phosphatases, PtpA and PtpB. PtpB is essential for the survival of Mtb in the host, but its molecular functions are unknown. We now show that PtpB is not a protein tyrosine phosphatase as previously assumed, but has strong similarity to lipid phosphatases, offering novel experimental routes to define PtpB substrate(s) and function. To understand how PtpB mediates Mtb survival in an infected host, we will identify the host substrates of PtpB by substrate trapping, as well as lipidomics and transcriptomics using genetic and chemical PtpB knockouts. Combining these global approaches, we will broadly capture PtpB's effect on the cell and identify PtpB-dependent changes in host lipids. Together, these studies offer a new route towards the understanding of Mtb host manipulation through the essential virulence factor PtpB. Because PtpB is emerging as a novel therapeutic target, these studies will also provide the framework for advancing drug leads.","2D"
2013,8424243,"5 R01 AI061505-08","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and most of these infections are latent. Tubercle bacilli can remain inactive in lung lesions only to emerge decades later to seed new outbreaks of tuberculosis. In addition, tuberculosis is one of the most difficult bacterial infections to treat and continues to cause more deaths than any other bacterial infection. Bacilli exist in replicating and non-replicating states in a range of microenvironments that vary in oxygen concentration and nutrient availability. The bacilli that survive during latent infection likely exist in a non-replicating state and antimicrobials, effective against actively growing bacteria, are often not effective against non-replicating bacteria. Little is known about the metabolic mechanisms employed by Mtb to survive latent infection or the hostile microenvironment of necrotic caseous tubercle lesions where oxygen is limited and nutrient sources suboptimal. Mtb cannot grow but endures in the absence of aerobic respiration. Therefore, the non-replicating anaerobic state is considered a prime model for persistent bacilli in vivo. In the absence of aerobic respiration Mtb requires a functional electron transport system to drive ATP synthesis. However, the core metabolic mechanisms by which the bacilli maintain redox balance are unknown. Therefore, our central research question is  What metabolic mechanisms are employed by Mtb when aerobic respiration is inhibited?  At least three factors limit Mtb aerobic respiration: the inhibitory effect of macrophage-produced nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, and the structure of mature granulomas. All three of these conditions strongly induce the DosR regulon, a regulon essential for anaerobic survival. However, the regulon does not encode a complete recognizable intermediary metabolic pathway. Our expression analysis and biochemical data strongly indicate that Mtb - an obligate aerobe - maintains a unique multifaceted intermediary pathway for metabolism in the absence of aerobic respiration. Thus, throughout the evolution of Mtb as a frank human pathogen, it has maintained an extensive array of enzymes which appear to be geared specifically for anaerobic metabolic functions. The pathway predicts that Mtb has the potential to metabolize lipids and all other major carbon sources anaerobically. Antimicrobials designed to kill non-replicating anaerobic bacilli are sorely needed. Our research directly supports this goal. New antimycobacterial drugs and drug combinations are routinely tested against hypoxic/anaerobic bacilli, but questions about the proper protocol and our limited understanding of relevant intermediary metabolic pathways limit a rational approach to drug design. Our preliminary data suggests we are at the brink of a fundamental understanding of Mtb anaerobic metabolism. Our working hypothesis is: Mtb employs a novel anaerobic metabolic cycle in conjunction with the DosR regulon to confer survival during non- respiring conditions within TB lesions. To test this hypothesis we will investigate key aspects of the proposed anaerobic metabolic pathway.","2D"
2013,8424258,"5 R01 AI100685-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will enable an ultra high throughput screening strategy to identify novel potent inhibitors of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) particle assembly. Current treatments of HIV-infected AIDS patients are based on combinations of drugs that target several critical key steps in the early and late stages of the viral replication cycle. While highly effective drugs have been developed, continuous emergence of multi-resistant viral strains requires the discovery of new classes of drugs directed against novel HIV targets. We will focus on the capsid protein (CA), the main component of the HIV virion: its dimerization is the first step in assembly of the viral particle. No anti-HIV drugs have yet been clinically developed against this target. Methods to measure capsid multimerization have however been recently used to identify proof-of-principle peptides and small compound inhibitors which block viral assembly and HIV replication, including in HIV strains resistant to drugs targeting viral enzymes. We designed an ultra High-Throughput Screening-amenable assay (uHTS), and companion screens and counter-screens to identify potent and selective inhibitors of capsid assembly. By combining transfer-of-energy biochemical screens with secondary assays in HIV-infected cells, we will enable the discovery of novel compounds of high affinity. We will successively i) perform a primary uHTS screen in a 1,536 well microplate format to identify inhibitors of HIV CA dimerization in the well-precedented 350,000 compound MPLCN library ii) triage compounds interfering non-specifically with the specific or unrelated protein-protein assays, and eliminate hits cytotoxic for cells used for studying effects on HIV, ii) evaluate hit compounds on HIV-infected cells for their ability to inhibit CA production and HIV infectivity, iv) verify the stage of the life cycle affected by the inhibitors, v) survey the spectum of HIV-1 and HIV-2 laboratory-adapted and clinical strains inhibited by our compounds. To demonstrate dimerization using alternately tagged CA proteins, we designed a set of complementary and orthogonal assays. The primary TR-FRET assay will be optimized in 384-well microtiter plates and validated in pilot screens of model Libraries (e.g.: LOPAC) before running a large MPLCN screen, using as references the NYAD-1 peptide and the PF-74 small compound capsid inhibitors. Our HIV CA-specific AlphaScreen will serve as a companion assay to help characterize hit compounds for further biologic validation. Several counter-screens will serve to eliminate false-positive hits. CA-specific inhibitors will be differentiated by their capaity to inhibit interactions between the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the CA protein, by using CA-based assays. Secondary cell-based assays HIV infectivity assays will be used to characterize non cytotoxic specific high-affinity inhibitors of HIV replication. The stage of the HV replication cycle targeted by the hits will be identified in comparison with other known anti-HIV compounds including AZT, Efavirenz and Saquinavir. Our goal is to provide the scientific community with freely accessible robust assays and potent, diversely acting HIV capsid inhibitors active in nanomolar concentrations.","6A"

I bring a unique perspective as an internist caring for underserved women in combination with my research in theory-based motivation applied to HCV services utilization and intimate partner violence (IPV) safety behaviors. I am interested in the underlying motivation impacting health services utilization of women in criminal justice settings from both the clinical and public health perspectives. I will be examining this motivation in the Drug Treatment Court setting. Self Determination Theory (SDT) is the empiric motivational model informing my research. This research will require increased expertise in health services, research design, quantitative assessment and analysis, SDT, and the cycle of co-morbid conditions impacting women defendants. My approach combines an empiric strategy, the criminal justice setting, and a gender and trauma-informed approach to needed healthcare services. I will adapt my SDT-based motivational intervention to create a program I call the Women's Initiative Supporting Health (WISH). Under-treatment of HIV and HCV among individuals in criminal justice settings is a major public health issue.1 While treatments differ, similar risks exist for HIV and HCV infection and under-treatment.2,3 The NIDA, CDC, and American Public Health Association are calling for effective and generalizable approaches for HIV and HCV treatment as a research priority in the criminal justice population. The institutes' recommendations support addressing combined risks in women, in the context of a high prevalence of child abuse or IPV histories. Furthermore, they recommend adapting services to meet individual needs. The goals of my proposed research project are consistent with these national priorities.1, 4-7 Evidence shows that women with SUD, while in long-term incarceration, can adhere to treatment of HIV and HCV. However, an unmet challenge is their post-release health services utilization. Additionally, to break the cycle of substance abuse, HIV, HCV, medical under-treatment, incarceration, and trauma, concurrent interventions are needed.8 Effective strategies are needed to engage this complex population in treatment. Drug Treatment Courts have been effective with a reward and sanction model in engaging participants while decreasing substance use and recidivism.9-11 Yet they usually do not address healthcare utilization. Motivational interventions have proven effective in difficult-to-treat populations suffering from SUD, nicotine addiction, HIV, and diabetes.12-16 They support destigmatization of targeted behaviors across varied ethnic, socio-economic, and marginalized populations.17-19 This is key in the criminal justice setting. However, the theoretical model underlying motivational approaches is not widely understood. SDT is an evidence-based theoretical model which establishes autonomous motivation as a mediator for improved health behavior in populations, including those with SUD or HIV.14, 20 Health conditions of subsets of the criminal justice populations are poorly understood. For example, women in criminal justice settings are medically under-studied. The prevalence of HIV and HCV is unknown in the Drug Treatment Court population. In my proposed K23 project I will begin my long-term career plan by examining the feasibility and effects of WISH in under-treated women Drug Treatment Court defendants. I will investigate the role of SDT in predicting changes in motivation for treatment influencing HIV and HCV-related services. Exploring proximal motivation outcomes insures the relevance of my proposal regardless of the effect of WISH. During the K23 m entored period, I will obtain research training and knowledge through mentoring and directed coursework. I will build upon my knowledge and experience using the Stage Model of Behavioral Therapies.21 I will establish myself as an independent investigator by studying promotion of appropriate service utilization. The K23 Mentored Clinical Scientist Award will allow me to accomplish the following goals: 1. Adapt and describe WISH in the criminal justice setting. 2. Obtain training in research methods: a) relevant to the unique needs of persons with co-morbid SUD, HIV,  HCV or criminal justice involvement (ethics, CBPR, health services); b) advanced quantitative approaches 3. Become expert in SDT regarding approach, measures, and outcomes. 4. Provide background data to inform an R01 award application to be written during year 4 of the project. With departmental mentor and research resources in substance abuse, HIV, SDT-based health behavior change, criminal justice collaborations, women's health, services utilization, and clinical research methods, I am ideally suited to benefit from this K23 award. My background provides me the depth of understanding and the ideal timing to undertake this career development research plan effectively addressing complex service needs of women with SUD, HIV, HCV, and IPV risk, and trauma histories. The compelling public health needs of these women defendants mandate a creative, broad based approach.","5B"

Among current strategies, protein vaccines fail to stimulate cellular responses, while plasmid DNA or live recombinant vectors capable of promoting cellular and humoral responses together face other issues, such as potency in humans (DNA), or challenges of vector-specific immunity and/or safety (live vectors). We propose here a new class of lipid-based vesicles for protein vaccine delivery, composed of multilamellar lipid vesicles stabilized by the introduction of crosslinks connecting the bilayers of the structure. These novel materials are synthesized and encapsulate protein antigens in a mild all-aqueous process, favoring the preservation of epitopes on complex antigens. In preliminary studies, we show that these novel vaccine carriers can be repeatedly administered for homologous boosting: Following a prime and 2 booster immunizations with a model antigen, these particles massively expand antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells, to the best of our knowledge substantially stronger than any previously reported protein vaccine. These T-cells were functional in terms of their capacity to produce IFN-?, and formed a substantial memory population a month after the second boost. In other preliminary studies, we found that this same system drives potent humoral responses against a candidate malaria antigen. Based on these promising initial results, we propose here to test the promise of this new vaccine delivery approach in the context of HIV vaccination, aiming to determine whether potent, durable T-cell and humoral responses can be elicited against HIV gag and env antigens. In addition, we will explore whether particular aspects of this vaccine system (e.g., the deposition of particles at the injection site) can be exploited to direct the localization of memory cells to key mucosal tissue sites that could promote protection against HIV infection. Our specific aims are: (1) How do the humoral and cellular responses to gag and env antigens evolve as a function of antigen dose and boosting with ICMV particle vaccination? (2) Are alternative clinically-relevant TLR agonist/danger signals capable of eliciting stronger immune responses than MPLA when delivered by ICMV vectors? (3) How do particles retained at the injection site influence memory/effector cell trafficking following ICMV particle immunization, compared to traditional protein immunization? (4) Can microneedle delivery be used to allow repeated needle-free particle boosting to be performed, without the need for refrigerated vaccines? Identification of ICMV formulations that can raise immune responses against HIV immunogens comparable to those shown in our preliminary data for OVA or malaria antigens will set the stage for subsequent testing in macaque protection models (either using ICMV vaccination alone or in tandem with other strong HIV vaccine candidates.","4B"

Little is understood about the pathogenesis of this infection because suitable models of central nervous system (CNS) infection are lacking. We have developed a murine model of congenital HCMV infection which recapitulates many of the histopathological and neurodevelopmental abnormalities described in congenital HCMV infections, including hearing loss in surviving mice. In contrast to earlier models, newborn mice injected peripherally with murine CMV develop viremia and subsequently, encephalitis. Because newborn mice are neurodevelopmentally and immunologically equivalent to late 2nd trimester human fetuses, this model has also enabled us to study resolution of this virus infection in a developing animal. In this proposal we will study aspects of the CNS infection in these animals including mechanisms of neuroinvasion, the contribution of innate immune responses in clearance of the virus from the CNS, and the interplay between innate immunity and adaptive immune responses in clearance of virus from the CNS. Lastly, the contribution of both innate and adaptive immunity in persistent CNS infection in adult mice infected as newborns will be studied. We anticipate that parameters of the pathogenesis of CMV infection in the developing CNS will be identified from these studies. Furthermore, we believe that these findings can be translated directly into more focused studies in humans that could lead to new approaches for prevention and treatment of this important infection.","2D"

Topics covered include the evolutionary history and diversification of retroviruses, advances in and the application of new mathematical algorithms, modeling of the interaction between the virus, the host and its immune response, and infection dynamics and epidemic behavior. Program Committee governance and oversight assures the quality, novelty and consistency of a highly interactive meeting. The selected speakers ensure wide geographical representation, good gender balance, and attendance of young investigators who are developing their reputations in the scientific community and who will invigorate the field. The meeting has enhanced interactions among the attendees to create an active network for theoreticians and experimentalists in order to address fundamental issues and accelerate discovery in HIV/AIDS research. Because of its uniqueness, the meeting can accomplish what other meetings cannot with regard to generating knowledge, creating new consensus, increasing opportunity for collaboration, and opening new areas of evolutionary biology research. The multidisciplinary venue allows trainees and young investigators just starting their career paths to interact closely with internationally recognized experts for mentoring. The annual meeting has grown in scope and significance, fundamentally reshaping the HIV/AIDS research landscape. The 17-year history of the meeting shows feasibility, expertise in the topic, and a track record of working together. To disseminate information and explore this area of scientific research, the specific aims of the meetings are to: facilitate communication of the most recent results relating to HIV dynamics and evolution; provide a forum for debate and discussion of alternative hypotheses in these areas; and integrate new mathematical approaches into pathogenesis research, drug therapy, and vaccine design.","8A"
2013,8424323,"5 R01 EB012946-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV is a significant global health problem- recent estimates suggest ~33 million people living with HIV, with 96% residing in the developing world. While HIV antiretroviral therapy is effective and increasingly available, quantitative monitoring of treatment is necessary to provide proper care to patients, and to control the emergence and spread of drug-resistant strains of HIV worldwide. Such tests are urgently needed for resource-limited settings to avoid staggering increases in health care costs associated with drug resistance and switching to second- and third-line therapies. However, current inexpensive, qualitative, yes/no diagnostic tools cannot guide treatment or monitor drug resistance, and current quantitative PCR-based assays require expensive equipment and complex environments unsuitable for point-of-care (POC) in resource-limited settings. Additionally, isolating and concentrating viral RNA is challenging for most POC approaches.  The SlipChip is a highly innovative technology from the PI's laboratory that uniquely combines a high level of performance with simplicity of fabrication and operation. The chip consists of two plates that move- or  slip - relative to one another, lubricated by a fluid that is immiscible with the sample fluid and also provides control of surface chemistry and prevents cross-contamination. Slipping brings wells in the two plates in and out of contact to execute a diagnostic assay, and manipulations of volume ranging over 7 orders of magnitude (e.g. from 100 pL to 1 mL) can be performed on the same chip. The SlipChip will facilitate integration of i) upstream sample preparation to isolate and concentrate viral RNA with ii) quantification of viral particles via nucleic acid amplification using  digital  (single molecule) detection using isothermal amplification chemistries, with iii) downstream signal amplification to enable simple readout.  The team that includes PI, co-PIs and a diverse set of industrial and global health collaborators has expertise spanning development of innovative micro-technologies, to molecular biology of RNA and isothermal nucleic acid amplification, to clinical use of diagnostic assays, to development and dissemination of FDA- approved diagnostics tests, to manufacturing, filling and packaging of plastic disposables, to manufacturing of diagnostic equipment, to working with AIDS patients both in the US and in India and Nigeria. This team would ensure that all research is done in the correct context of global health and in the context of chemistries, disposables, and equipment that can be manufactured inexpensively and used in resource-limited settings.  The development of a POC device to monitor HIV viral loading fits within two of the five priorities of the NIH as articulated by Director Francis Collins: it will have a large impact on global health, and it has the potential to ultimately reduce healthcare costs in the US. Long term, this work would lead to SlipChip platform as a  disruptive innovation  to improve healthcare by reducing costs, and simplifying and increasing availability and applicability of nucleic acid-based molecular diagnostics.","6A"
2013,8424360,"5 F32 AI098492-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to investigate the mode of action of a fragment of heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein U (hnRNPU) that was identified in a genetic screen for genes or gene fragments that could inhibit HIV-1 replication. This fragment maps to the N-terminal 86 amino acids of hnRNPU (N86-hnRNPU) and mediates a potent block in wild type HIV-1 replication. Further analysis into the mechanism of action revealed that N86-hnRNPU induced retention of HIV-1 mRNAs in the nucleus and a concomitant reduction in the cytoplasm. Since the half-life of HIV-1 mRNAs is unaffected by the fragment, these observations suggest that N86-hnRNPU induces a block in HIV-1 mRNA export. In our preliminary studies, we've found that the N86-hnRNPU fragment associates with the full-length hnRNPU protein via co-immunoprecipitation, and through confocal analysis we have seen that N86-hnRNPU and hnRNPU co-localize in the nucleus. Deletion analysis of the N86- hnRNPU fragment has shown that removal of 68 amino acids from the N-terminus has no effect on the restrictive capacity of the fragment suggesting that the 19 amino acids (68-86 in hnRNPU) may be sufficient for restriction. One hypothesis is that N86-hnRNPU may be affecting a potentially positive role of endogenous hnRNPU in HIV-1 mRNA export. An alternative hypothesis is that N86-hnRNPU affects cellular factors involved in mRNA export such as TAP and the SR protein 9G8. The later has been shown to act as an export adaptor for TAP-mediated export and bind to HIV-1 mRNAs. We will study whether the above mentioned (or other) cellular proteins are inhibited by N86-hnRNPU resulting in the observed block in HIV-1 mRNA export. We will visualize the distribution of HIV-1 mRNAs via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which may give us insights into the type of block based of the spatial arrangement of HIV-1 mRNAs in the nucleus. Finally, we will test whether N86-hnRNPU restricts HIV-1 infection in the biological target, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Together, these experiments will lead us closer to understanding the mechanism of N86-hnRNPU mediated restriction of HIV-1 mRNA export. We hope to gain valuable insights into previously unknown aspects in HIV-1 post-integrations steps that might lead to the identification of novel therapeutic avenues.","7A"
2013,8424659,"1 R21 AI103514-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis B virus causes chronic infections in approximately 350 million people worldwide. All are at significantly increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Although virus replication can be blocked by therapy with nucleoside analogs, infected hepatocytes are not cured, because covalently closed circular DNA (CCC DNA), the template for transcription of viral RNAs persists in infected cells. So far, a therapeuti strategy to functionally inactivate or even destroy CCC DNA within infected hepatocytes is lacking. We propose to use transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) specific for CCC DNA to cleave and mutate CCC DNA in regions essential for viral DNA replication. Hence, the goal of this application is to obtain proof of principle for the idea that an infected hepatocye can be cured of HBV through inactivation and possibly destruction of CCC DNA. Preliminary experiments from our laboratory already demonstrated that CCC DNA is indeed susceptible to cleavage by TALENs. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate the potential of TALENs to functionally inactivate CCC DNA by insertion/deletion of bases during the repair reaction, or to even destroy CCC DNA and to determine whether TALEN-based antiviral therapy could lead to the cure of infected cells. As a model for HBV, we will be using duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) expressed in hepatoma cells and primary hepatocyte cultures that permit all steps of viral DNA replication including the formation of CCC DNA. The goals of this application will be achieved through the following two aims: Aim 1. Construction and validation of TALENs specific for DHBV. The purpose of this aim is i) to construct TALENs against three targets on DHBV required for DNA replication, ii) to measure the ability of each TALEN to cleave CCC DNA, iii) to determine the effects of cleavage on CCC DNA stability, and iv) to investigate whether cleavage by TALENs leads to integration of CCC DNA into chromosomal DNA. Aim 2. To determine the antiviral activity of TALENs. The purpose of this aim is to study the effect of TALEN-based therapy on infection of dividing hepatoma cells and non-dividing primary duck hepatocytes. We will investigate whether TALEN therapy leads to a time-dependent reduction in CCC DNA levels per cell and determine not only if CCC DNA can be functionally inactivated in non-dividing cells, but also if it can be destroyed without a need for cell death. Furthermore, we will determine whether TALEN therapy can protect hepatocytes from de novo infection.","6D"
2013,8424944,"7 R21 AI090156-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endothelial and epithelial cells are a major target in vivo for HCMV and potentially an important site for initiation of virus transfer across the placenta to the fetus in congenital infection. In HCMV, the gH/gL glycoprotein complex and viral proteins from the UL128-131 locus are required for endocytic viral entry into endothelial/epithelial cells. This viral entry pathway is separate from the gB entry pathway found in fibroblast cells. Antibodies against proteins of the UL128-UL131 locus and endocytic complex can neutralize virus infection of endothelial/epithelial cells. We hypothesize that a vaccine strategy which includes components of the endocytic viral entry pathway as neutralizing target antigens would be a more effective vaccine against congenital infection. The studies will be carried out using guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) because of species specificity of HCMV. The guinea pig is the only small animal model that allows the study of congenital cytomegalovirus infection. An added complication of studying bona fide full length CMV and virus entry into endothelial/epithelial cells is the propensity for deletion of the UL128-131 locus when virus is grown on fibroblast cell lines. This happens in both HCMV and GPCMV, which complicates infection studies on endo/epithelial cells. We propose to use a novel approach of a lentivirus transduced tet-off complementing cell line system expressing missing GPCMV genes (GP128-131) to produce pseudotyped GPCMV encoding part or all of the components of the presumed endocytic pathway. Our hypothesis is that we will be able to determine the relevant proteins necessary for the endocytic pathway of GPCMV infection of endothelial cells via this strategy. Furthermore, we hypothesize that once the minimum components of the endocytic pathway protein complex are identified they can be included as part of a novel vaccine strategy based on a replication impaired (DISC) virus which will enhance the protective immune response against congenital CMV compared to a DISC virus lacking this locus.","6D"
2013,8424954,"5 R21 AI097061-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant seeks to increase our understanding of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) sexual transmission by studying five HCV sexual transmission pairs. Data suggests that HCV can replicate in several anatomic compartments including the liver, white blood cells, and within the genital tract (1-3). Furthermore, viruses replicating in these different compartments can be characterized by small differences in their sequences. The primary aim of the research is to determine where in the transmitting partner the HCV that established infection in the recipient came from by determining their sequence characteristics. Following identification of transmission pairs where HCV was likely acquired via sex, samples of bodily fluids that may be involved in transmission will be collected from the source partner including semen and blood. Blood will also be collected from the subject in the pair who acquired HCV infection. Following isolation of HCV from these fluids we will use massively parallel sequencing methods to generate a detailed sequence signature for the HCV in the various compartments. We will then compare these sequence signatures between the transmitting and recipient partners to determine where the virus that infected the partner likely originated in the transmitter. A second aim of the research is to determine whether difference exist in HCV sequences and distribution between persons who are co-infected with HIV and those who have HCV alone. To accomplish this an additional 5 subjects will be enrolled so that we can analyze 5 HCV and 5 HCV/HIV chronically infected subjects who either transmitted HCV or would be possible HCV transmitters.","2D"
2013,8424962,"5 R21 AI093198-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long range goal of our research is to develop an effective vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection. We plan to use avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) as vectors for delivery of HIV-1 proteins. APMVs do not cause disease in humans and there is no preexisting immunity in humans to APMVs. There are nine serotypes of APMVs, therefore, several serologically distinct vectors can be developed to express different HIV genes for use in prime-boost immunization approach.     As a first step towards our goal, we propose here studies to optimize the expression level of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env), its incorporation into virus particles and the strategy of immunization. We have chosen to use APMV-1, also known as Newcastle disease virus (NDV), because this is the most studied member among APMVs. The results obtained with NDV can be extended to other APMV serotypes in the future. The first objective of our proposal is to identify the optimal 5' and 3' untranslated regions of NDV genes for insertion into HIV Env transcriptional unit to enhance its expression. We will also attempt to enhance the incorporation of HIV Env into NDV envelope by replacement of transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail sequences of HIV Env protein with those of NDV F protein individually and collectively. The second objective of our proposal is to evaluate different inoculation routes and prime-boost approaches for eliciting robust systemic and mucosal immune responses in guinea pigs. The optimal strategies will subsequently be moved into monkey studies.","4B"
2013,8424964,"5 R01 MH096633-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving Outcomes for Orphaned Youth: Implementation of Trauma-focused CBT  The primary goal of this R01 proposal is to study the effectiveness of Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) in treating traumatic grief and traumatic stress for orphaned children and young adolescents in two East African sites with high prevalence HIV, Moshi, Tanzania (TZ) and Bungoma, Kenya (KE), through a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The mental health gap in low and middle income countries (LAMICs) is substantial, with few individuals in need of treatment receiving even basic care. Orphaned children and adolescents currently number 143 million worldwide, with nearly 50 million in Sub-Saharan Africa alone, 16.6 million due to HIV/AIDS. These are vulnerable children, who often have mental health problems subsequent to parental death as well as high rates of trauma exposure. In our feasibility study of TF-CBT with orphans in Tanzania, we have found a group-based TF-CBT intervention to be feasible and acceptable, with promising clinical outcomes. In the feasibility study, lay counselors with no prior mental health experience delivered the intervention with training and supervision by our team of mental health and TF-CBT experts.  Building on this initial study, we propose a RCT to test the effectiveness of TF-CBT for traumatic grief and traumatic stress compared to receipt of usual care orphan services in TZ and KE. The study extends our prior work in three ways: 1) includes a comparison condition; 2) includes two countries to examine broader applicability and effectiveness; and 3) involves partnering with the experienced lay counselors from the feasibility study to train and supervise lay counselors, in an attempt to build local responsibility and take steps toward sustainability. The proposed study involves collaboration with HIV/AIDS grassroots organizations and local Co-Investigators in TZ and KE, both of whom are longstanding collaborators with our US team and are located in mixed urban and rural areas, allowing examination of effectiveness in two countries and two settings (urban/rural). Using a task-shifting approach, in which lay individuals are trained as counselors, we will train nine counselors in each country, who deliver 20 groups in each site (10 rural, 10 urban), resulting in 320 children and adolescents (ages 7-13) who receive TF-CBT and 320 who receive usual care. Outcomes for children are assessed at 12-14 weeks (i.e., corresponding with the end of TF-CBT), 6-months post-treatment, and 12-months post-treatment. TF-CBT experts from our team partner with the lay counselors from the feasibility study (e.g., local trainers) to train the TZ ad KE counselors, and these local trainers provide the TF- CBT supervision, while supervised themselves by the US-based TF-CBT and mental health experts. We expect this trial to yield recommendations regarding an effective intervention for orphans that is acceptable, feasible, and includes local responsibility as a means to enhance potential sustainability in LAMICs. Findings will inform other efforts to scale up mental health interventions to address the substantial mental health gap.","5A"
2013,8425021,"5 R01 AI089378-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With approximately 14,000 new infections per day, there is an urgent need to develop a safe and effective HIV vaccine. However, all of the strategies tested to date have fallen short of this goal. Thus, new strategies are required if the development of a safe and effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection is ever to be realized. A recent HIV Vaccine Summit held at NIH in March 2008 listed nine high priority research objectives essential for the development of an HIV vaccine. The work proposed in this grant directly addresses one of the nine highest research priorities listed, namely:  Determine why broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are uncommon and how they can be elicited . Our new approach to this problem is based on surprising preliminary results showing that cleavage sites on HIV gp120, recognized by intracellular and secreted enzymes known to be important for antigen processing, tumor growth, and parasitic infection, are highly conserved. Surprisingly, these sites are also located at, or adjacent to, specific amino acids important for receptor binding or the binding of neutralizing antibodies. Because of the high rate of virus variation, these sites must have been conserved as the result of strong selective pressure, possibly to evade the immune response. In this proposal we wish to inactivate these conserved cleavage sites on HIV envelope proteins to create protease resistant envelope glycoproteins. We will then express these in quantities required for rabbit immunogenicity studies. The resulting sera will be assayed for the presence of broadly neutralizing antibodies. We postulate that inactivation of these sites will preserve important epitopes that are normally degraded in vivo before they are able to stimulate robust immune responses. Preservation of these epitopes should allow us to redirect the immune response to HIV envelope proteins in a way that improves the formation of broadly neutralizing antibodies. These experiments have the potential to explain why it has been so difficult to elicit neutralizing antibodies with the vaccines tested to date, as well as other observations that have perplexed the field for many years.","4B"
2013,8425033,"5 R37 AI055332-10","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a wide consensus that an HIV vaccine should elicit protective antibodies. To ensure that optimal responses are elicited, it is important to understand how antibodies exert their protective activity in vivo. For instance, is it only necessary to elicit antibodies that can neutralize in vitro, as is the current focus of immunogen development? Or are other antibody functions, present in vivo but not present in in vitro neutralization assays, important? If so, which functions? We are approaching the mechanism(s) of antibody protection in vivo using the SHIV/macaque model and a broadly neutralizing human anti-HIV antibody (b12) that we have studied intensively in the laboratory. In particular, we are attempting to probe mechanism by investigation of the protective effects of engineered variants of b12 whose ability to interact with other compartments of the immune system has been altered. We have provided evidence to suggest that the interaction of antibody and host cell Fc receptors is important in protection and now propose to explore this involvement more deeply to determine the features of antibody responses, in addition to neutralization, that will provide benefit in the context of a vaccine. The specific aims are: (1) To determine the roles of the key Fc receptors FcRIIa and FcRIIIa in antibody protection against mucosal HIV challenge (2) To determine the effects of greatly enhancing the major FcR functions, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis, on antibody protection against mucosal HIV challenge and (3) To investigate in vitro how monoclonal and polyclonal anti-HIV antibodies mediate the extra-neutralizing activities shown in Aims 1 and 2 to be crucial in antibody protection. These studies will help define the antibody specificities, and particularly combinations of specificities, most likely to offer optimal protection against HIV exposure.","4A"
2013,8425060,"5 R01 AI038382-20","DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator):  Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the most common sexually transmitted viral infections, resulting in genital warts, intraepithelial neoplasia and anogenital cancers. Diagnosis and treatment of HPV-associated disease is extremely costly. The recent introduction of prophylactic vaccines has the potential to greatly reduce infection and disease caused by the two types responsible for approximately 70 per cent of cervical cancers, HPV 16 and 18, and the quadrivalent vaccine, which also includes HPVs 6 and 11, can prevent up to 90 per cent of genital warts. However, the relatively modest uptake of the vaccine, especially in the developing world, and the very high fraction of men and women who are already infected, means that HPV-associated disease will remain a significant public health problem for decades. Thus, continuing to better understand the natural history of genital HPV infection and the basis for a protective immune response is an important goal. The development of serologic assays to detect HPV antibodies has allowed an assessment of the prevalence of HPV infection, which complemented estimates of active infection made on the basis of detecting HPV DNA in genital tract specimens. The assays have improved in sensitivity, and multiplexing methods now make it possible to measure antibodies to dozens of HPV types, as well as defining immunoreactive epitopes. In aim 1, we will use the multiplex assay to examine the prevalence of 20 HPV types in sera from our existing cohorts of young women and men, for whom there are repeated serological, HPV DNA, and sexual behavior measures. The goal of aim 2 is to develop even more sensitive serologic assays by employing a new technology in which the detection of antibody is greatly increased by coupling the anti-human antibody with a DNA tag that is amplified by PCR. Detection of HPV low levels of HPV antibodies in serum, oral exudates and cervical lavage will provide new tools and insights into the natural history of infection. Aim 3 will examine the epitopes on the HPV 16 virion that elicit antibodies, using an approach in which the type-specific surface exposed loops have been swapped for the corresponding residues of HPV 31. It is of particular importance to characterize the differences in antibody reactivity induced by natural infection compared to vaccination. By understanding the basis of the HPV 16:31 cross-reactivity it may be possible to engineer more broadly protective vaccines. Aim 4 provides a unique opportunity to characterize HPV antibody maturation over time. Vaccination stimulates a large number of naove B cells that can be identified using Solexa sequencing technology to sequence segments of the rearranged V(D)J immunoglobulin genes, coupled with computational analyses. By vaccinating HPV 6,11, 16, 18 naive men and examining their B cell repertoire over time it will be possible to identify HPV-responsive clones and the somatic hypermutation that results to improve antibody binding. Taken together these studies will provide important new information on the prevalence of genital HPV infections and new insights into the basis of protection against HPV infection.","2F"
2013,8425085,"5 R01 AI083757-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antigenically naive CD4 expressing a¿-T cell receptors are critical for generating immune responses to neoantigens, and are produced de novo within the thymus as mature CD4+CD8- thymocytes. These enter the periphery to become recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) of the naive CD4 T-cell compartment. Although monitoring of CD4 RTEs is of great clinical interest, particularly in CD4 T-cell lymphopenia, direct evaluation of human CD4 RTEs has been limited by a lack of specific surface markers. This project will utilize a novel and recently identified surface marker for human CD4 RTEs, protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7), to define CD4 RTE frequency, phenotype, and function. Preliminary results validate PTK7 as a CD4 RTE marker, and show that PTK7+ CD4 RTEs have a reduced capacity for effector function compared to PTK7- naive CD4 T cells. Aim 1 will use gene expression profiling by deep mRNA sequencing of unstimulated and stimulated PTK7+ CD4 RTEs and other CD4 T-lineage cells to: 1) define the extent of residual thymocyte gene expression in PTK7+ CD4 RTEs during ontogeny, and 2) identify gene products involved in reduced CD4 RTE immune function, particularly for Th1 generation and/or that subdivide PTK7+ CD4 RTEs into more versus less recent thymic emigrants. Aim 2 will use in vivo labeling to test the hypothesis that PTK7+ CD4 RTEs are the direct precursors of PTK7- naive CD4 T cells, and will determine the role of PTK7+ CD4 RTEs in maintaining naive CD4 T-cell numbers and 12-TCR repertoire diversity in HIV-1 infection. Aim 3 will use a similar approach to test the importance of PTK7+ CD4 RTEs in immune reconstitution of naive CD4 T cells after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Aim 4 will define the kinetics of loss of PTK7+ CD4 RTEs in children and adults following complete thymectomy and the impact of this loss on naive CD4 T-cell numbers and 12- TCR repertoire diversity. Together, these studies will substantially enhance our understanding of the role of thymic RTE production in maintaining the peripheral naive CD4 T-cell compartment in health and disease.","2C"
2013,8425102,"5 R01 DA029663-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Combination antiretroviral therapy has provided many HIV-infected individuals with a near-normal life expectancy, provided they have access to care and can maintain strict lifetime adherence to the daily or more frequent treatment regimens. The most important factor in the virologic failure of an antiretroviral regimen is poor adherence of the patient to complete and proper dosing. HIV-infected IDUs face well-documented challenges to maintaining optimal adherence. Accordingly, this group, which represents approximately one- quarter of the U.S. HIV epidemic, has yet to derive the full benefits of the available antiretroviral therapies. Various interventions to improve antiretroviral drug adherence, ranging from counseling to directly-observed therapy and other structural interventions, have had only modest success. We propose a novel treatment strategy involving systemic administration of long-acting antiretroviral therapy as a means to ensure effective drug delivery and viral suppression in HIV-infected populations prone to poor drug-adherence. We propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of weekly subcutaneous treatment with the CCR5 monoclonal antibody PRO 140 in combination with a standard-of-care oral antiretroviral regimen. PRO 140 is uniquely suited for this use as it is the only HIV drug to demonstrate long-acting viral suppression without the need for slow IV infusion. Success in this pilot study would identify a new strategy for improving the care of HIV-infected IDUs and other vulnerable populations that are underserved by the current generation of antiretroviral medications. Positive results could catalyze this field and spur development and testing of other long-acting HIV drugs in this population.","6B"

Drug-resistant strains (MDR and XDR-TB) are an emerging problem and could lead to significant issues in the US because over half of the cases are in foreign born persons. Recently, the combination of the carbapenem, meropenem, and clavulanate was shown to be active against XDR-TB strains in vitro and importantly effective against nonreplicating bacilli. Meropenem only has a one-hour half-life and is administered only by injection. The objectives of this application are to synthesize prodrugs of meropenem that are orally bioavailable. Three prodrug strategies have been designed 1) Make a non-toxic acyloxycarbonyloxy esters (proxetil, suberolyl prodrugs) 2) Synthesize valeryl or dipeptidyl esters that are taken up by PepT1, an intestinal dipeptide transporter and 3) Prepare a bivalent prodrug that releases meropenem and clavulanate simultaneously. The prodrugs could also be used for oral switch therapy for serious Gram-negative infections caused by organisms such as Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter. Prodrugs will be evaluated both in vitro and also in vivo in guinea pigs. Metabolic stability and Caco-2 permeability studies will be done to insure adequate release and uptake. Bioavailability of five candidate prodrugs will be determined in a crossover study after administration of intravenous meropenem and oral prodrugs. Finally, for the best prodrug, meropenem penetration into lung and spleen will be evaluated after oral dosing compared to an intravenous meropenem infusion. Efficacy studies will be conducted in a BSL-3 laboratory in the guinea pig model of TB.","6D"

ZNAs are oligonucleotides conjugated to a number of cationic spermine moieties that enhance the effective concentration of primers and probes near nucleic acid targets.  This property has been reported to enhance the speed and sensitivity of RT-PCR (Moreau et al. 2009).  ZNAs are compatible with Taqman detection formats (Paris et al. 2010).  We expect this detection technology will further accelerate our RNA detection assays as well as increase our accuracy.   We will compare the performance of ZNA to LNA DNA dual labeled (Tong et al. 2008, Li et al. 2010) and CPT probes.  By the end of the study we will have completed the analytical study stage required for the commercial release of an IsoAmp HIV-1 quantitative assay.  Our phase I research plan includes 4 aims:    1. Design and test ZNA primers targeting all subtypes of HIV-1,    2. Design and test with both ZNA taqman and ZNA cycling probes for the HIV assay,   3. Develop a simple work flow for extraction of RNA from dry blood spots (DBS) and dry plasma   spots (DPS), and   4.

At the conclusion of Phase I, we will be ready to identify the best probe technology to develop a commercial IsoAmp HIV-1 quantitative assay for commercial distribution in the US and abroad.  We will also have a clear indication of the type of sample extraction method that best suits HDA viral load  testing.

2013,8426089,"5 R01 MH094160-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) have persisted at a high prevalence in the era of combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) in spite of increased HIV suppression and immune reconstitution. The majority of HAND studies have been performed in developed countries on patients infected with HIV-1 subtype B. However, two-thirds of the 33.4 million people living with HIV/AIDS are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and are infected with non-B HIV subtypes, including recombinant viruses. The HIV epidemic in Cameroon and nearby areas of West and Central Africa is characterized by both a broad diversity of HIV-1 clades and the emergence of a circulating recombinant form that combines clades A and G (CRF02_AG). The HIV-1 CRF02_AG strain constitutes the predominant (52 to 84%) viral genotype in Central and West Africa, a region that includes 26 countries with over 456 million inhabitants. Furthermore, this mosaic virus is spreading to other parts of the world and is now present in Europe, Asia, and America, but nothing is known of its CNS effects and neuropathogenesis. Considering the AIDS pandemic and global geographic distribution of HIV subtypes, it is possible that viral genetic diversity influences its spread and neuropathogenesis; however, the effects of HIV genotypes and recombinant HIV strains on viral transmission, infectivity, and neuroAIDS are not known. Our proposal fills this important knowledge gap. Our preliminary studies showed increased in vitro replication capacity of HIV-1 CRF02_AG in human macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, compared to its parental subtypes A and G and Western HIV-1 subtype B. Because the primary role of Tat is to transactivate viral gene promoter and induce transcription, it is likely that Tat play a major role in this increased replication of CRF02_AG isolates. We further show that HIV-1 CRF02_AG Tat amino acid (AA) sequences form a monophyletic cluster and are different from Tat sequences of other HIV-1 subtypes. Thus, we hypothesize that CRF02_AG has increased fitness compared to subtype B virus, and this increases its cytopathicity, neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury. We further hypothesize that HIV genotypes influence the host's susceptibility to HAND and disease progression. We propose to test these hypotheses in three specific aims. Aim 1: Use a battery of neuropsychological (NP) tests in HIV- and HIV+ Cameroonians to develop norms. Aim 2: Investigate the effects of HIV genotypes on viral fitness and the host's susceptibility to HAND. Aim 3: To test our hypothesis that differences between CRF02_AG and subtype B Tat AA influence Tat transactivation and toxicity. These novel studies are significant and will help determine the effect of HIV genetic variation on viral fitness, Tat transactivation and neuropathogenesis. Data generated will provide insights into the link between HIV genetics, epidemiology, and HAND.","2G"

2013,8426116,"5 R01 DA031189-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to contribute to the prevention of three interrelated, harmful and costly behaviors that peak in early adulthood: drug abuse, HIV/AIDS-related sexual risk behaviors and intimate partner violence (IPV). The project builds on the 20-year multisite prospective Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN). LONGSCAN includes structured interviews with high-risk youth and their primary caregivers every two years from age 4 through 18 and regular review of Child Protective Services records with detailed coding of child and adolescent maltreatment (CM). The proposed study aims to add a wave of data collection when participants are between 22 and 25 years old. The specific aims are to: 1) examine the impact of CM and related risk factors on age of drug use onset, trajectories of use, and Substance Use Disorders (SUD); 2) test the independent and combined effects of CM, related risk factors, and drug use on HIV/AIDS-related sexual risk behavior and IPV; 3) test the independent and combined effects of CM, drug use, related risk factors, and mutable protective factors on early adult resilience across multiple domains; and 4) test innovative models of the long-term patterns of neglectful parenting and their impact on drug outcomes, sexual risk behavior and IPV. Neglect is by far the most prevalent form of CM and the most strongly associated with parental drug abuse of any CM type, yet also the most understudied regarding its long-term course and effects on drug use. Predictive models will include tests of potential moderation by three risk factors (violence exposure, maternal depression, and parental, family, and peer drug use) and three protective factors (maternal emotional support, positive father involvement, and caregiver stability). Hypotheses for each aim will be tested using general growth mixture models, structural equation models, latent class models, and tests of model invariance. By analyzing rich multi-informant data across 14 years of childhood and adolescence to predict the development of early adult SUD, sexual risk behavior, IPV, and resilience in a high-risk sample, the proposed project will substantially enhance the empirical foundation for the development of prevention, services, and policies targeting drug abuse and related health risk behaviors. This project will increase our knowledge of the development of three major public health problems following CM: drug abuse, sexual risk behavior, and IPV. By assessing maltreated and high-risk youth who have been followed since age four as they transition to adulthood, this study will identify key risk and protective factors, and the ages at which they are most influential. Results will inform prevention, treatment and policy.","1A"
2013,8426161,"5 R01 DA029532-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to establish the functional relevance of exogenous cannabinoids in modulating responsiveness of microglia to the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) trans-activating (Tat) protein. Microglia are resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) that serve as principal targets for HIV-1. These cells are productive hosts for HIV-1 and elicit a plethora of cytokines, monokines, and neurotoxic factors in response to infection. Included among these are the virus envelope glycoprotein gp120 and the virus-specified gene product Tat. While both proteins can activate uninfected microglia and immunocytes in the CNS resulting in an expansive release of inflammatory and neurotoxic factors, the production of Tat by HIV- infected cells is not affected by currently available anti-retroviral drugs since these target the reverse transcriptase and protease enzymes of HIV. This observation, taken together with the fact that Tat is released extracellularly, articulates a rationale for assessment of its role in HIV neuropathogenesis in the current highly- active antiretroviral therapy era. Tat exerts robust chemotactic properties and may recruit uninfected microglia and other immunocytes to focal areas of HIV-1 infection. The combined action of chemotaxis-driven aggregation of immunocytes at focal areas of infection and elicitation of inflammatory factors may be a major contributive factor in the development of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Cannabinoids have been shown to modulate the functional activities of immune cells, including those of microglia. The preponderance of these effects has been inhibitory and mediated through the CB2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R). Since this receptor is expressed by microglia during various states of neuroinflammation, it has the potential to serve as a cell-selective molecular target for ablating untoward immune responses, including those engendered by Tat. Thus, the CB2R may serve as a template for the generation of specific ligands devoid of psychotropic properties and rationally designed based on the critical features of the receptors with which they interact. In the proposed study we will test the hypothesis that select exogenous cannabinoids act through the CB2R, and possibly other cannabinoid receptors, to dampen microglial inflammatory responses to Tat. The following specific aims will serve as guidelines to the research: (1) to define the in vitro effects of exogenous cannabinoids on human microglial responsiveness to the HIV protein Tat, (2) to establish the mode of action through which exogenous cannabinoid alters microglial responsiveness to the HIV protein Tat, and (3) to establish the relevance of the effects of exogenous cannabinoid on microglial responsiveness to Tat in the context of human mixed glial cultures and mouse brain slice cultures.","2G"
2013,8427333,"5 R01 HD057614-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In resource poor regions of the world where HIV is endemic, especially countries in sub-Saharan Africa, nutrition plays a critical role in HIV disease. Nutrition affects the health of HIV-infected women and children, and may influence the risk of mother to infant transmission of HIV through breast milk. Nutrition influences the risk of tuberculosis (TB) and TB disease severity. Existing research has focused on the role of micronutrients in HIV disease outcomes but has not addressed the role of protein calorie supplementation (PCS) in subpopulations of patients with HIV disease at high risk, specifically; HIV-infected women who are either breast feeding or have active TB. Our hypotheses are that administration of a culturally acceptable PCS is a practical, sustainable and effective strategy to: 1) decrease HIV viral load in plasma and breast milk of breast feeding women, enhance passively transferred immune mediators in breast milk, and improve HIV outcomes in women and their breast-fed infants and, 2) decrease HIV viral load, enhance TB-specific T cell immunity, and improve outcomes in women with HIV and active TB. Our two specific aims are to show that these strategies are effective in randomized clinical trials. Drawing on the 8 year DarDar collaboration between Dartmouth and Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences in Tanzania we will conduct 3 nutritional studies among HIV-infected women in Dar es Salaam. Study A will enroll 160 HIV+ and HIV- women who are either  breast feeding (BF) or have active TB to conduct dietary interviews and focus groups to quantitate existing  nutritional deficiencies and to define a culturally acceptable PCS. Studies B (118 HIV+ and 60 HIV- women who are breastfeeding) and C (118 HIV+ and 60 HIV- women with active TB) are randomized controlled trials which will compare the effects of 6 months of PCS + micronutrient supplement (MNS) vs. MNS alone on overall disease outcomes as well as specific surrogate markers of HIV disease, specific immune factors in breast milk and specific T cell responses against TB. Findings from these studies are expected to have a major impact on policies for nutritionally vulnerable HIV subpopulations.","1A,5B,6D"
2013,8427344,"5 R01 DA025548-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the number of new HIV infections has been relatively stable since late 1990s, the face of the infection has changed. Half of all new infections now occur among youth and substantial disparities exist based on sexual orientation. Recent data from the National HIV/AIDS Reporting System indicate that male-to-male sexual contact accounts for 76-79% of HIV diagnoses among 16-19 year old males, although less is known about the actual prevalence of HIV and related health issues in this population. Disparities also exist in preparedness to prevent HIV among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), with no proven intervention for adolescents in this vulnerable group. The epidemic of HIV among YMSM does not exist in a vacuum. Instead, YMSM experience multiple psychosocial health disparities, including elevated rates of illicit drug use, exposure to violence, and mental health problems such as suicidality. Recent evidence indicates that these health issues represent intertwined epidemics that each contribute to HIV risk among YMSM, a situation referred to as a syndemic. Building on our own research with YMSM, as well as other high risk youth, we are proposing to investigate a syndemic of psychosocial health issues linked to HIV among YMSM ages 16-20. This syndemic includes HIV risk, drug use, internalizing mental health problems, and violence exposure. The overarching goals of this study are twofold: 1) to provide much-needed epidemiological data on the prevalence of HIV and related health issues in order to inform public health priorities; and 2) to collect vital information on risk and protective factors to inform the development of an intervention targeting this vulnerable population. We will accomplish these goals with three primary specific aims: (1) Ascertain the prevalence and clustering of a syndemic of biopsychosocial health problems among YMSM. We will: (a) Recruit a representative sample of 450 ethnically diverse YMSM using Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS); (b) Assess the syndemic components using state-of-the-art approaches; (c) Use the RDS model to calculate unbiased estimators of the prevalence of syndemic components; (d) Test for the clustering of syndemic components. (2) Characterize multiple trajectories of syndemic development by following our YMSM sample longitudinally over a two year period. We will: (a) Assess youth every 6 months during the transition from late adolescence to emerging adulthood, to explore the natural history of syndemic development. (b) Use growth-mixture modeling to characterize groups of youth with different trajectory classes of syndemic development in order to allow for early identification of youth most at risk of HIV acquisition. (3) Determine the importance of YMSM-specific factors in syndemic development so as to guide the development of culturally-relevant HIV prevention interventions for our target population. We will: (a) Test the value of YMSM-specific factors as predictors of trajectory class; (b) Test the incremental value of our theoretical syndemic model for predicting HIV-related sexual risk relative to the IMB model.","5B"
2013,8427351,"5 R01 AI095038-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this application, we are proposing to create a novel class of anti-HIV-1 immunotherapeutics by conjugating HIV-1 fusion inhibitors to exceptionally broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNABS). The cell surface receptors utilized by HIV-1 (CD4, CCR5, CXCR4) are attractive targets for therapy because they are under no pressure to evolve resistance. Unfortunately, HIV envelope protein (Env) mutations are readily evolved to escape small molecule receptor blockade. Likewise, bNABs have been discovered that neutralize up to 90% of tested viral strains but when HIV is challenged with antibodies, in vivo resistance quickly develops. In both cases, the resistance is due to mutations in the Env, although mutations to escape one molecule can make HIV more sensitive to another. Our hypothesis is that a bNAB modified with anti-HIV fusion inhibitor would be an exceptionally potent compound and that a sufficiently modified bNAB would be multifunctional and act as single molecule  cocktail.  Such a compound would make evolution of resistance very difficult for HIV because it would require many mutations to escape the binding sites of the bNABs and the sterically blocked cell receptor sites. We propose to synthesize validated small molecule HIV inhibitors that target the co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4, as well as, small molecules that bind and disrupt the CD4/gp120 fusion. These compounds will be synthesized linked to protein reactive moieties which will allow for specific modification of bNABs. Our lab has recently developed two different approaches for specific targeting of tyrosine residues for this purpose. The well characterized and very broadly neutralizing antibodies PG9 and VRCO1 will serve as the scaffold for modification. In addition to chemical modification, we will also investigate creating genetic fusions to combine the Fv's of PG9 and VRCO1 onto a single molecule, as well as, engineering the Fc domain to increase in vivo half-life. Multi-specific antibodies will be assessed for their ability to neutralize a broad panel of HIV-1 isolates including strains which are resistant to the bNABs and the small molecule fusion inhibitors. Successful candidate antibodies will then be assayed for half-life and toxicity. Finally, multi-specific antibodies will be used in an HIV escape assay to test our hypothesis that these molecules can pose an evolutionary challenge that HIV cannot answer. We anticipate that the products of this research will be exceptionally potent and broadly active HIV-1 immunotherapeutics and prophylactics.","6I"
2013,8427355,"5 R01 AI093278-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are expected to be a crucial component of vaccine-elicited protective immunity against HIV-1. However, all attempts to elicit such responses to date have failed. The lack of progress in this area could relate to the insufficient authenticity of candidate immunogens. A consistent finding of immunogenicity studies has been that while immune sera efficiently bind to the index immunogen, few Abs recognize the native form of Envelope glycoprotein (Env) found on virus particles. Because nAbs have the select ability to bind to these Env trimers, we hypothesize that Env trimers may in turn be the only antigen capable of selectively and reliably inducing nAbs in a vaccine setting. Testing this hypothesis has until now been impossible, due to problems in isolating pure native Env trimers. For example, particulate vaccines bear many non-functional forms of Env on their surfaces, as well as native trimers. These alternative forms of Env are  promiscuous , in that they are recognized by non-neutralizing Abs (non-nAbs). As a result, they interfere with the development of nAbs. Here we describe new methods to completely eliminate non-functional Env, which will allow us to isolate and test pure authentic Env trimers as vaccines. Our Specific Aims are:    Specific Aim 1: To produce virus-like particles bearing authentic Env trimers as the sole form of Env. We are attempting to eliminate non-functional Env from particles, leaving only intact trimers. New strategies have brought us close to achieving this goal.    Specific Aim 2: To generate soluble forms of pure authentic Env trimers. We are investigating methods to purify authentic soluble Env trimers. The antigenic topology and stability of pure soluble trimers will be characterized.    Specific Aim 3: To evaluate pure authentic trimer immunogens in rabbits. The results from immunizations of successive groups of animals will guide improvements in the consistency, magnitude and breadth of nAb responses. The kinetics, duration and specificity of nAb responses will be characterized.    Specific Aim 4: To rescue broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies using pure trimer VLPs as  bait . BnmAbs are useful tools for vaccine design. Pure authentic Env trimers may be ideal  baits  for selecting memory B cells, allowing new bnmAbs to be rescued. We will generate fluorochrome-labeled baits and work in collaboration with a group who has recently demonstrated a flow cytometry method to rescue new bnmAbs from HIV-1-infected donors. The neutralization potency, breadth and specificity of any newly identified bnmAbs will be determined. We will also examine IgG sequences and the extent of divergence from the germline.","4B"
2013,8427357,"5 R37 AI028571-24","Our efforts to study HIV-1 protease structure and function in the current funding period have yielded exciting results that form the basis for a new hypothesis, that there is a structural pre-organization of the Gag/Pol protein that brings the p2/nucleocapsid (NC) cleavage site in close proximity to the active site of the protease dimer (PR). The efficiency and order of processing can be influenced by mutations within the region from p2 through p6p¿'. In the new Experimental Plan, we will explore the interactions between upstream regions of Gag and PR. In addition, we will extend our analyses of protease structure and function to subtypes other than subtype B. Specific Aim 1 will focus on the influence of mutations within the Gag/Pol fusion protein on the efficiency and order of processing. Our current work has identified several points within the region from the start of protein p2 through the end of the p6po1 [HXB2 amino acids 364-440] where mutations affect processing. We will use a selective mutagenesis method on the full-length gag/pol gene to identify other points of importance within the limits of amino acids 364-440. We will employ an in vitro transcription/translation system to analyze the effects of mutagenesis. Specific Aim 2 will study the Gag-Pol polyprotein processing and examine the properties of the proteases from a variety of subtypes including A2, C, D, H, and F, and recombinant forms A/G, A/C, and B/F, which we have obtained from the NTH AIDS Research & Reference Reagent Program. We will use the same approach as in Specific Aim 1 to examine the rate of and intermediates in polyprotein processing of variants derived from the non-B subtypes. This will provide more natural variants of the Gag-Pol polvprotein sequence and expand our understanding of the consequences of sequence variation. The region of Gag/Pol between matrix (MA) and PR from the non-B subtypes will be placed into our recombinant virus system for analyses of growth to complement the biochemical and structural studies. The presence of a variety of different forms of the virus globally demand that we evaluate the properties of proteases from subtypes other than subtype B, which is predominant in the US and has been used in studies of resistance development,. We will begin with subtypes C, A2, and H. The genes will be subcloned, expressed and purified, and analyzed for kinetic properties, inhibitor binding using clinically-approved drugs, and three-dimensional structure in complex with a variety of the same inhibitors. Specific Aim 3 will explore the properties and the structure of a variety of extended forms of HIV-1 protease, with increasingly longer sequences upstream of the protease, as we know that the initial steps in processing occur in the region upstream of protease. We hypothesize that there is a structural pre-organization of Gag/Pol that brings the C cleavage site [p2/NC] near the active site cleft of the protease, resulting in the initial rapid cleavage of that junction. If this structure can be observed by crystallography, through the construction of an inactive protease-Gag fusion protein, then we will identify a new target for drug discovery, i.e., the interaction surface for formation of the pre-cleavage structure. In addition, we will explore the potential of interactions between the wild-type and mutant forms of protease from Specific Aim 1 and the NC protein as alternative targets for drug discovery.","6A"
2013,8427362,"5 R01 NS066801-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After almost three decades of AIDS epidemic, we are still challenged with the fact that more than one out of three people with productive infection of HIV-1 develops some form of HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), which remains refractory to the conventional antiviral therapeutics. In addition, the clinical symptoms of HAND are found to coexist with those of other systemic inflammatory diseases in a significant proportion of patients, some of which are associated with a higher number of activated platelets in the circulation. This may suggest that a common underlying mechanism is at work in these infected individuals. In this respect, HIV-infected patients exhibit increased numbers of activated platelets in the plasma in a manner that relates to the severity of the immunologic deficit, however, it is unknown whether platelets play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of HAND. Here we demonstrate that the systemic administration of physiologically relevant levels of Tat produces evidence of platelet activation in the plasma, followed by enhanced permeability of the BBB and inflammation in the CNS. These effects were abolished when Tat was administered to animals that had first been depleted of platelets, supporting the notion that platelets might play a crucial role in HAND. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the activation of peripheral platelets by effector molecules released by HIV-1-infected cells elicits abnormal effects on brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVEC), thereby altering blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and exacerbating inflammation in the CNS. Three fundamentally critical questions are addressed in this proposal. The first is whether inflammatory mediators released by HIV-infected cells also target other immune effector cells, such as platelets (Aim 1). Second, if activated platelets in turn activate BMVEC to stimulate inflammatory vascular changes that are connected with BBB permeability (Aim 2); and last whether the effects caused by platelets facilitate frequent passage of peripheral blood monocytes through an otherwise normal BBB (Aim 3). The obvious corollary to this is whether therapeutic manipulation of platelet activity provides protection from neurologic damages induced by HIV. Thus, the experiments proposed herein have great translational potential for the development of new therapeutic strategies for neuroAIDS.","2G"

Building on the confluence of new information showing that CD14-positive Monocyte-associated HIV DNA Viral Load (CD14MADVL) correlates with NCI, coupled to unpublished data from co-investigator S. Gartner documenting a highly distinct virus in CD14 positive monocyte, the current proposal targets in depth pathogenesis research of the virus in this compartment drawing from a unique prospective cohort of treatment naive patients recruited from a large Nigerian PEPFAR program. The conceptual framework for this project draws from the well established fact that HIV enters the brain primarily via the trafficking of infected blood monocytes and virus in this compartment provides a window for understanding the pathogenesis of NCI without direct access to brain tissue. Our preliminary studies document capacity to enroll and detect large numbers of treatment naive patients with NCI, maintain them in prospective follow up and perform in depth laboratory analysis of the virus from monocytes, CD-14 negative mononuclear cells, plasma and CSF. The central hypothesis of this grant application is that the previously reported correlation between severity of NCI and CD14MADVL is linked to a distinctive pattern of viral quasi-species in this compartment (unpublished preliminary data) and that detailed analysis of viral motifs among the quasi-species from this compartment compared to non-monocyte HIV DNA and plasma viral RNA offer promise for identifying signature patterns that will inform NCI pathogenesis. This hypothesis will be addressed in two aims: Aim 1 - Classification of NCI and correlation with CD14MADVL in cross sectional study and longitudinally, and Aim 2 - Detailed study of the virus engaging targeted quasi-species analysis to characterize distinguishing motifs associated with NCI, and to study the relationship to viral subtype and the relationship of viral drug resistance in different compartments to NCI. The research team is comprised of internationally recognized HIV, neuro-AIDS and molecular virology experts from the University of Maryland, leading neuro-AIDS scientists from the University of California San Diego HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center (UCSD/HNRC), and local research investigators from the Institute of Human Virology-Nigeria (IHV-N) and affiliates in Nigeria.

The U.S National Intelligence Council (NIC) predicted that the number of HIV-infected individuals in the developing world will rise to 80 million by 20102. Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV has been available in developed countries for more than a decade. However, worldwide, less than 10% (1.3 million) of the infected individuals currently receive treatment, since they live in developing countries. Part of the problem associated with existing ART delivery systems are the limitations of conventional methods to diagnose and monitor infected individuals living in rural poor communities.

2013,8427368,"5 R01 AI054977-09","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has become increasingly clear that the workings of the thymus include greater complexity than first appreciated. Not only is this organ a generator of CD4 and CD8 T cells, but it is also a site for development of highly specialized lineages of natural killer T (NKT) cells, intraepithelial T lymphocytes, regulatory T (Treg) cells, and innate-like CD8 T cells. The detailed molecular mechanisms that control the differentiation of these distinct T cell sublineages from common precursors remain to be determined. Here we focus on the role of TOX (thymocyte selection-associated HMG box protein) in this context, a nuclear DNA-binding protein first identified in our laboratory as a regulator of thymic selection events.  We produced TOX-deficient mice, demonstrating that TOX is required for development of the canonical CD4 T cell lineage as well as NKT and Treg cell development. Inhibition of the specific stage of T cell development that is affected in these mutant animals has not been reported previously, allowing novel insights into the process. In addition, we have found that TOX plays roles outside the thymus, including an obligatory role in NK cell development and lymph node organogenesis. We propose here three specific aims to delineate the role and mechanism of action of TOX in development of the immune system. First, we will investigate the relationship between TOX and regulation of CD4 and ThPOK expression in the thymus, the latter a dominant CD4 lineage commitment factor. In addition, we propose a novel approach to identify TOX-dependent genes involved in establishment of the CD4 lineage gene program, and will compare the role of TOX in development of different T cell lineages. Second, we will analyze the role of TOX in development of lymph node organogenesis, focusing on the potential for TOX to regulate lymphoid tissue inducer cell development. We also have replicated the inhibition of NK cell development in the absence of TOX in a culture system. We propose detailed analysis of the role for TOX in this context, including whether TOX might function to regulate another nuclear factor that shares some functional properties with TOX. Third, we propose state-of-the-art approaches to identify direct gene targets and protein binding partners of TOX, in an in vivo context of CD4 T cell development.  TOX is highly conserved between rodents and humans, as is its expression pattern. Thus, these studies should provide insight into workings of the human immune system as well. TOX defines a small protein subfamily that includes three other members, one of which has been implicated as a breast cancer susceptibility locus, while TOX itself is highly expressed in some cancer cell lines and tumors. Understanding the mechanism of action of TOX is therefore likely to impact both human health and disease.","2C"

The long-term goal of the investigator is to develop, implement, and evaluate innovative and multidisciplinary interventions to reduce the incidence of HIV infection among women and girls in the developing world. The proposed scope of work includes both training and research components that capitalize on the rich interdisciplinary research environment at the University of California, Berkeley as well as the institutions of the candidate's advisory committee. The training component forms the foundation of the proposal and includes two senior mentors, a panel of advisors with complementary expertise, didactic education, skill development, and mentored research such that at the completion of the award the candidate will be well-positioned for an independent research career. The training plan has been developed in parallel with the mentored research plan such that when new education and skills are obtained they can be immediately applied to the relevant aspects of the research program. Four training objectives will be accomplished during the course of this award: (1) obtain education in the responsible conduct of research, economics, and international development policy; (2) obtain practical skills in agricultural and resource economics, intervention development, and the conduct and analysis of experimental epidemiological studies; (3) complete a mentored research program to design and pilot an HIV prevention intervention; and (4) become an independent investigator through building the publication record, mentoring by subject matter experts, and generating pilot data for a future proposal. The goal of the research component is to examine how the economic context shapes women's vulnerability to HIV infection in rural Tanzania and to pilot an intervention to economically empower women farmers and reduce HIV infection. The promotion of women's economic empowerment is increasingly viewed as a promising approach to HIV prevention in Sub-Saharan Africa as the lack of access to and control over economic resources heightens susceptibility to HIV infection. This proposal takes an innovative approach to HIV prevention by focusing on agriculture, which is inextricably linked to poverty and food security in the developing world. However, few interventions have systematically integrated agricultural livelihoods, food security, and HIV prevention. The research aims are to: (1) investigate the potential for a sustainable agriculture-based livelihood intervention to reduce the risk of HIV infection among women farmers in Tanzania; (2) determine the effect of household income, food insecurity, and land ownership on sexual risk-taking among female-headed farming households in Tanzania; and (3) conduct a pilot study of a sustainable agriculture- based livelihood intervention for women farmers in Tanzania to improve household income and food security and reduce sexual risk-taking. This study will provide quantitative and qualitative evidence to determine whether a future trial is merited for the intervention. There is a clear need for empirical evidence about the effects of economic insecurity on HIV vulnerability. In addition, the development of multi-sectoral responses to prevention that can address the entwined economic, social, and contextual risks with which African women contend is imperative. This proposal has been designed to address both of these needs and the results will have important implications for future responses to the HIV pandemic.","5A"

The objective of this application is to develop and test a reliable, valid instrument to measure pediatric ART adherence for children ages 0 to 14 years in western Kenya. The rationale for developing a validated adherence measure is to gain the ability to measure adherence accurately, test interventions to improve adherence, and assess if therapies optimize clinical outcomes. This work will be done within a long-standing US-Kenya partnership, the Academic Model for Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH). AMPATH cares for over 80,000 adult and pediatric HIV-infected patients in western Kenya, including over 2,800 children on ART. I plan to accomplish the research objective of this application by pursuing the following three specific aims: Aim 1: Develop a reliable, valid comprehensive pediatric ART adherence measurement questionnaire (CAMP - Comprehensive ART Measure for Pediatrics); Aim 2: Develop a reliable, valid, short-form version of the pediatric ART adherence measurement tool (SF-CAMP) for use as an adherence screening measure in busy clinical care environments; Aim S: Evaluate the field-readiness, implementation feasibility, and clinical utility of CAMP and SF-CAMP within the AMPATH HIV clinical care system in western Kenya. I also propose a course of training, study, and mentorship in the design and testing of health behavior measurement tools for International settings, the use of psychometric analyses to develop and validate clinical tools, and evaluation of pediatric HIV care. The combination of research work and my career development plan will enable me to become an independent clinician-scientist who can improve pediatric HIV care provision.","5C"
2013,8427982,"1 R03 AI103638-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To successfully eliminate malaria, which continues to be responsible for 8% of all the deaths of children under five, new malaria control strategies are needed, including transmission blocking (TxB) vaccines. Toward this goal, we have recently produced correctly-folded P. falciparum gametocyte surface protein P48/45 (Pfs48/45) in a form that is ready for GMP production (GMZ3) and induces antibodies that disrupt parasite infectivity to mosquitoes in a standard membrane feed using in vitro culture-adapted parasites. We hypothesize that anti-GMZ3 antibodies will also block the ability of natural parasite isolates to infect mosquitoes and that naturally acquired TxB immunity will correlate with the presence of antibodies that recognize GMZ3 indicating that it is a good vaccine candidate. To test this we propose to AIM 1) evaluate the ability of anti-GMZ3 antibodies produced in rats to block the infectivity of natural isolates to mosquitoes. We will also evaluate AIMS 2 & 3) whether natural parasite exposure induces Pfs48/45/GMZ3 antibodies that contribute to transmission-blocking immunity. Pfs48/45 is one of four Plasmodium proteins (Pfs48/45 and P230, P25 and P28) that are the targets of monoclonal antibodies that effectively block malaria Tx and have been targeted as vaccine candidates. All these proteins are relatively cysteine-rich with multiple disulfide bonds resulting in antibody epitopes that are dependent on tertiary structure rather than linear amino acid sequence. Only P25 has advanced to a Phase Ia clinical trial, but further development has been slow due to limited immunogenicity and the lack of boosting during a natural malaria infection. Both Pfs48/45 and Pfs230 are expressed as the parasite undergoes sexual differentiation into gametocytes in the human host and naturally occurring anti-Pfs48/45 antibodies have been found after exposure to malaria. This suggests that the immune response against a Pfs48/45 or Pfs230-based TxB vaccine could be boosted during a natural infection enhancing the efficacy of the vaccine. The project proposed here will directly evaluate the potential of GMZ3 as a vaccine candidate against natural isolates. It augments ongoing epidemiologic and clinical safety studies by directly comparing transmission-blocking activity with gametocyte prevalence, genetic variation and anti-rPfs48/45.10C antibody titers and will provide critical information to direct the further development of an effective transmission-blocking vaccine.","6D"
2013,8428298,"1 R03 AI104258-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intra-subtype recombination is an efficient strategy applied by HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1) to generate extraordinary virus diversity that contributes to intra-patient quasi-species and drug resistance. Here we propose a novel methodology to detect HIV-1 intra-subtype recombination to fill the gap between the necessity of tracking HIV genetic changes along disease progression and transmission and lack of intra-subtype analysis methodologies. Due to greater sequence similarity, intra-subtype recombination is harder to detect than inter-subtype recombination. Therefore the detection of intra- subtype recombination, not only in the HIV case but also in other organisms, should consider appropriate array of sequences that can reflect a full spectrum of diversity within a subtype. In this regard, we hypothesize that these sequences have existed more abundantly in sequenced fragments but are less present in sequenced complete genome sequences, while the latter are widely used in any kind of HIV recombination studies. Our rationale derives from our previous study, in which we successfully identified sub-subtypes within HIV-1 subtype J. Our findings were based on sequenced fragments rather than complete genome sequences. We believe that the repertoire of all published sequence fragments contains a great degree of sequence diversity that we have overlooked in many aspects of studies, including viral molecular evolution and molecular epidemiology studies. The objective of this project is to (1) identify sub-subtype representative sequences within each HIV-1 subtype; and (2) implement a high-throughput scheme for detection of viral intra-subtype recombination. Our proposed study will provide a basis for a rational and quantitative evaluation of the prevalence of HIV-1 intra-subtype recombinants, which is critical for tracking the dynamic and complex HIV epidemic and designing improved antiviral therapies and vaccines. Last but not the least, our proposed research strategy can also be applied to the recombination study in other viruses.","2B"
2013,8428335,"1 R21 AI103648-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) greatly increases the risk to develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and genotypes B and C account for majority of chronic HBV infection worldwide. Although these two genotypes infect similar human population (Asians) via the same (vertical) mode of transmission, infection with genotype C is associated with prolonged active virus replication, delayed HBeAg seroconversion, and increased lifelong risk for HCC. Genotype C is also more prone to develop core promoter mutations, which have been independently associated with HCC risk. Our preliminary studies revealed that core promoter mutations up regulate genome replication and core protein expression when introduced into clones of genotype A and C. We also found that most genotype C isolates with wild-type core promoter sequence produce less pregenomic RNA than corresponding genotype B isolates, leading to lower core protein expression and genome replication. Nevertheless, they are more efficient at virion secretion. Considering that the core protein is a strong immunogen, we hypothesize that its low expression by genotype C prolongs the immune tolerance phase of infection and delays HBeAg seroconversion, whereas efficient virion secretion ensures rapid virus spread in the liver as required for establishment of persisten infection. We also hypothesize that immune clearance mechanisms select for genotype C mutants with augmented replication capacity through core promoter mutations, with the concomitant increase in core protein expression triggering liver damage and HCC risk. In this R21 grant application we will identify the determinants and elucidate the mechanisms responsible for lower genome replication capacity of wild-type genotype C isolates but more efficient virion secretion. We will also test the alternative possibility that the low prevalence o core promoter mutations in genotype B is due to their inability to enhance genome replication in this particular genotype. Our working hypothesis and proposed studies will shed light on the higher prevalence of core promoter mutations in genotype C, and help solve the longstanding puzzle of why genotype C persists longer in the host to induce advanced liver diseases such as cirrhosis and HCC. These studies will also reveal novel control mechanisms in HBV genome replication and virion secretion. Our rich experience and proven track record in characterizing biological properties of HBV genetic variants will ensure successful completion of the proposed study.","2D"
2013,8428571,"5 R01 NR012150-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The HIV contraction rate for Latina women in the U.S. is six times the rate for non-Latina, White women. Latinas are suffering disparate negative consequences from substance use disorders, including intimate partner violence, incarceration, homelessness, and medical ailments. Our long-term goal is to reduce the incidence of HIV and substance abuse related health disparities among Latinas. The objective of this application, which is a significant step in pursuit of this goal, is to determine how substance use (both licit and illicit) and HIV risk behavior trajectories of a community-based sample of Latina mothers and daughters are influenced by changes in familial mechanisms (mother-daughter acoplamiento or attachment), cultural processes, and other social determinants of substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors over time. The study design involves four waves of data collection. Baseline data were collected in a cross-sectional pilot study of intergenerational drug use and HIV risk behaviors among Latina mothers and daughters funded by NIDA (R24DA014260, PI: Mario De La Rosa, Ph.D.). Three new longitudinal assessments are proposed to follow-up on baseline assessment. The first new follow-up assessment will be spaced approximately 5 years from the original study's baseline assessment. The remaining two follow-up assessments will occur 1 year from the preceding follow-up assessment. Our first aim is to determine the influence of cultural and social determinants on trajectories of change for substance use and HIV risk behaviors among a community-based sample of Latina mothers and daughters. The working hypothesis is that Latina mothers and daughters who experience (1) more acculturation to U.S. culture; (2) poorer socioeconomic conditions; (3) a loss of interpersonal supports; (4) less religious involvement; (5) involvement with the criminal justice system; (6) intimate partner violence; (7) greater employment, relationship, and/or residential related chronic stress; or (8) declining mental health and medical status since their baseline assessment will exhibit either an increase in or maintenance of high rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors over the 7 year assessment time period. Our second aim is to determine the influence of mother-daughter attachment on trajectories of change for substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Latina mothers and daughters who either increase their levels of attachment or maintain consistently high levels of attachment will report reduced or consistently lower levels of substance use and HIV risk behaviors over a 7 year time period. Our third aim is to determine the moderating role of mother-daughter attachment on associations between experiences of detrimental social determinants and trajectories of change for substance use and HIV risk behaviors.","1A,5B"

This study will be conducted in a representative population-based sample of over 12,600 adult men and women from rural and urban parts of Guntur district in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh in whom we assessed baseline seroprevalence of HIV, herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) and syphilis, and the sexual and other risk behavior during 2004-2005. We will conduct a 5-year follow-up of this cohort to estimate new HIV, HSV-2 and syphilis infections and ascertain the determinants of HIV incidence and the transmission dynamics at the individual, partnership and broader levels. In addition, we will assess the bias in reporting sexual behavior using a confidential polling box approach for a more realistic understanding of risky sexual behavior at the population level. We will also assess effective coverage of and barriers to key HIV prevention, treatment and care interventions at the population level to understand how their coverage could be enhanced. Assuming a loss to follow-up of 25% of the baseline sample, based on a recent pilot study, we estimate that there will be 85 incident cases of HIV (95% confidence interval 63-107) at 5-year follow-up, which would be a reasonable number to explore the associations of new HIV infections with their determinants. We will utilize field procedures standardized in the baseline study that will be adapted for the follow-up study. Trained field staff will document socio- demographic background, sexual and other risk for acquiring HIV, and utilization of HIV interventions through interview and they will collect dried blood samples on filter paper using the finger prick method. Ethical considerations will be paramount to minimize risk to study participants. The laboratory analysis for HIV, HSV-2 and syphilis will follow a strategy similar to the baseline study, using internationally accepted test kits. Confidentiality of data will be ensured. Multivariate regression techniques will be used to assess the association of new HIV infections with determinants at the individual, partnership, cluster and geographic area levels. Our proposed study will provide original scientific data and analysis of new HIV infections and their determinants at the population level, bias in sexual behavior reporting, and barriers to HIV interventions. These unique and rigorous data will fill several key gaps in the evidence base needed for the understanding of HIV transmission and its control in high burden parts of India.","1A"
2013,8428593,"5 R01 NR012907-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a period of physical, psychological, and social development. Many older adolescents (18-24 years old) engage in high-risk behaviors such as unprotected sex, multiple sex partners, and drug use. This has caused an increase in the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infected (HIV+) adolescents. In addition, many HIV+ adolescents continue to engage in high-risk behaviors leading to a further HIV spread. Current assessments of risky decision-making in adolescents involve self-administered surveys concerning sexual behaviors and drug use. It is imperative that early markers of risky behaviors are identified so that effective interventions are implemented to reduce adolescent HIV transmission.  This proposal will utilize non-invasive neuroimaging, such as arterial spin labeling (ASL), to quantitatively measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) within risky decision-making networks. Preliminary ASL studies have demonstrated that HIV diminishes CBF by 60% within risky decision-making areas. We will also use computer based neurobehavioral tests that simulate real-life risky decision making situations. Correlations between neuroimaging and neurobehavioral methods could provide us unique insights into the mechanisms that fuel the adolescent HIV epidemic. The overall direct impact of our research will be: 1) an increase in our knowledge concerning the interaction between risky decision-making and HIV in adolescents 2) the development of early neuroimaging and neurobehavioral markers that assess the impact of HIV infection on risky decision- making networks. These results will assist nurses, clinicians, and public health practitioners in developing interventions that could save lives and reduce the spread of HIV in this vulnerable population.","1B,1C,5B"
2013,8429402,"5 R01 AI049313-13","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant: M. tuberculosis remains a pathogen of global importance, currently infecting 1.6 billion people, killing 1.7 million annually. Successful human responses to infection depend critically on T cells, which were previously thought to be activated solely by peptide antigens bound to MHC proteins. However, CD1 proteins represent a newly discovered pathway for activation of T cells by mycobacteria and other pathogens. CD1 proteins are expressed in a highly regulated fashion on dendritic cells, where they capture mycobacterial lipid antigens for presentation to T cells. CD1 proteins are present in all mammals, so likely have an indispensable function in immune response. Although the basic functions of CD1d and NK T cells are becoming well understood, the natural functions of human CD1a, CD1b and CD1c proteins are not yet known. After discovering lipid antigens presented by CD1a (dideoxymycobactin), CD1b (glucose monomycolate) and CD1c (mannosyl phoshomycoketide), this renewal proposal uses a well developed model system to determine for the first time the general molecular mechanisms by which these antigens contact T cell receptors and the functions of lipid reactive T cells in human patients. Specifically, we will use chromatography and mass spectrometry to discover new antigens that bind to each type of CD1 protein and determine the general chemical rules of their recognition. Further, biophysical measurements and protein crystallization will determine the strength and mechanisms of how lipid antigens contact T cell receptors. Using human cells, we will measure the influence of the inflammasome and cytokines in regulating expression of CD1 proteins in dendritic cells and tissues. Last, we will use newly developed cell surface staining reagents to determine the key cytokines and anti-bacterial effector functions of T cells in cohorts of human patients located in Boston and KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. These studies are relevant to the mission of the NIH because they focus on human subjects with natural diseases so that results can be translated into the clinic. Identification of the molecules necessary to initiate CD1 antigen presentation and T cell activation would allow their development as adjuvants or vaccines. Because experiments measure the general functions of the CD1-antigen-T cell receptor interaction, results would also inform understanding of the pathogenesis of related T cell-mediated diseases like sepsis, Lyme disease, allergic asthma and atherosclerosis.","2D"

2013,8429483,"5 R01 AI070042-08","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration, catalyzed by the viral integrase protein, is an essential step in the life cycle of all retroviruses. This has highlighted the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) integrase protein as an important target for therapeutic intervention, and the first integrase inhibitor, raltegravir, was approved for use with AIDS patients in 2007. Because raltegravir-resistance arises in patients, there is an ongoing, important need to develop next generation inhibitors that will work to counteract drug-resistant strains, and this work is underway in the pharmaceutical industry. Such drug design efforts are helped significantly by knowledge of detailed structures of the targeted protein, as well as structures of drug-bound complexes. Drugs like raltegravir preferentially bind to and inhibit the integrase-DNA complex or intasome that forms after reverse transcription as compared to the free integrase protein, highlighting the crucial need for structural information on the HIV-1 intasome. Until recently, there was no experimentally derived structure for any retroviral intasome, but work conducted during the ongoing grant platform culminated in solving the x-ray crystal structure of the prototype foamy virus (PFV) intasome. To begin to understand the analogous HIV-1 structure, we have built a molecular model using the PFV structure as a scaffold, and work proposed herein will evaluate numerous integrase-DNA contacts unveiled in the model for their roles in integration in vitro and during virus infection. We moreover will adopt what we have learned during our extensive studies with PFV and apply this knowledge to solve the three-dimensional structure of the HIV-1 intasome. The HIV-1 structure will be an invaluable asset for basic research as well as clinical scientists, as it will define the structural basis of HIV-1 DNA integration and provide a crucial platform for development of next generation integrase inhibitors.","2B"

The candidate's long-term-career goal is to be an independently funded, academic pharmacometrician, with a rich and diverse experience in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling of antiretroviral drugs. In particular, the candidate will pursue prospective population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data collection, with the goal of quantifying age-related factors that influence drug response and toxicity. The candidate's short-term career goals fostered by this career development award are 1) to obtain formal training in advanced PK/PD, biostatistics, and computational methods, 2) to gain hands-on experience in population PK/PD modeling, 3) to foster working relationships with leading pharmacometricians, 4) to develop the preliminary data for an R34/U01 or R01 application, and 5) to expand her training in the responsible training of research. The proposed research plan, career development activities, and mentorship team are all uniquely suited to assist the applicant in achieving these goals. The research plan is built around the central hypothesis that: 1) altered ARV pharmacokinetics contributes to altered pharmacodynamics as measured by clinical response and toxicity, and 2) chronological age may only partly explain alterations in pharmacokinetics, and subsequently, pharmacodynamics. In this proposal, we will develop a pharmacokinetic and a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model in two specific aims for two common ARV regimens, emtricitabine/tenofovir/efavirenz (Atripla) and emtricitabine/tenofovir/atazanavir/ritonavir (Truvada, Reyataz, and Norvir). To accomplish these aims, we will use optimal sample design simulation to prospectively collect drug concentration and drug response data from HIV-infected adults receiving the regimens of interest. Subjects will be recruited from the University of North Carolina (UNC) Clinical HIV Cohort. To support the candidate's career development, she will pursue advanced coursework and independent study in the areas of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic theory and modeling, biostatistics, computational methods, and research ethics, in concert with hands-on modeling training. The mentorship team, which includes internationally-recognized, independently-funded investigators with expertise in ARV clinical pharmacology (Kashuba), pharmacometrics (Forrest), and HIV clinical care and research (Cohen), will guide Dr. Dumond's research, training, and professional development. The research environment including the NIH-funded Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute and Center for AIDS Research at UNC and the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, will provide a productive, collegial, and collaborative atmosphere in which to pursue the above research and training goals.       NARRATIVE By 2015, more than 50% of the HIV-infected population in the United States will be at least 50 years of age, and little is known about the optimal clinical care of aging HIV-infected patients. The goal of this and subsequent research is to identify patient-specific factors modifying antiretroviral response and toxicity. This could lead to specific treatment recommendations for older HIV-infected patients.","6B"

These cells are located at the squamo-columnar (S-C) junction of the cervix and their share attributes with preinvasive and invasive HPV-associated cervical neoplasms links support their role as progenitor cells. This project is designed to expand this investigation to accomplish three tasks. The first is to clarify the biologic differences of early cervical precancers with S-C junction specific attributes to better define the parameters that increase the empirical risk of eventually developing invasive cancer. Understanding these differences will permit a more precise classification of cervical precancers and reduce the likelihood of over-treatment and its reproductive sequelae. A related goal is to map the geography of these specialized S-C junction cells in the cervix to determine its influence on origin and successful removal of precancers. The second task is to grow these S-C junction cells in culture and determine both how they differentiate and if they express unique biomarkers relative to their surrounding cellular environment. Because the S-C junction is vulnerable to cancer causing HPV infections, these biomarkers could be exploited to devise novel therapies to selectively remove the S-C junction cells preemptively (for cancer prevention) via targeted therapy. The third task is to generate a transgenic animal model (mouse) in which a precise mimic of human cervical cancer could be generated at the S-C junction by introducing carcinogenic HPV-related oncogenes. Such models do not currently exist and their successful development could be an important advance in the creation of mouse models of human cervical cancer that could be used to test new therapeutics.","2F"
2013,8430071,"1 R21 AI103754-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) is a common pathogen with a seroprevalence rate that has been increasing in the US over the last several years. There is no vaccine or effective microbicide available against the virus. Apart from the discomfort associated with the symptomatic disease which results in genital ulcers, asymptomatic shedding greatly enhances person-to-person virus transmission. HSV-2 also enhances susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by 2-3 folds. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a strong microbicide and an effective vaccine. In this proposal we plan to explore the idea of developing a unique non-invasive mucosal microbicide/vaccine combo which initially functions as a microbicide by effectively trapping HSV-2 virions and rendering them non-infective and then provides a unique viral antigen displaying platform for the mucosal antigen presenting cells for processing, presentation, and induction of immunity. This novel platform is based on our uniquely designed zinc oxide micro-nano spike particles (ZnO-MNPs), which trap HSV virions with very high efficacy. The trapping, which concentrates the virions at one place, renders them unable to enter cells. We propose that high concentrations of trapped virions on ZnO-MNPs will elicit a very strong immune response without the need of any additional adjuvant, since ZnO is already shown to have good adjuvant properties. Another added advantage of our microbicide/vaccine combo is that Zinc oxide is already used in common cosmetic products. Two exploratory Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that ZnO-MNPs can act as an effective microbicide by preventing virus attachment to host cells in vivo. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that HSV-2 virions trapped by ZnO-MNPs can be recognized by mucosal antigen presenting cells and processed for immunity development. Overall, we expect to prove the vaccine efficacy of a new virostatic platform, which will have path defining implications for protection against HSV-2 and many additional viral diseases.","6D"
2013,8430702,"1 R01 AI103760-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CD4+ T cells play a major role in adaptive immune responses to intracellular and extracellular microbes by regulating the functions of B cells, CD8+ T cells, and phagocytes. However, the prevalence of phagosomal infections caused by Mycobacteria, Salmonella, and Cryptococcus in CD4+ T cell-deficient AIDS patients demonstrates that the most important function of these cells is phagocyte activation. Yet this function is poorly understood, which probably explains why no effective vaccines exist for these pathogens that kill at 2 million people every year. The size of this knowledge gap becomes clear when one considers the odd features of CD4+ T cell-dependent  concomitant immunity , which likely operates for all phagosomal infections. IFN-? producing Th1 cells control the infection within phagocytes at the initial site of infection and prevent it from spreading to other parts of he body. Oddly, however, the Th1 cells never eliminate the microbes from the initial site. Indeed, persistent infection at the original site is required for the Th1 cells to eliminate bacteria from other body sites after a second infection. The regulatory mechanisms that allow Th1 cells to control the infection without eliminating it are not understood. In addition, it is not clear why CD4+ T cell memory is not retained if the original infection is eliminated and why persistent infection does not result in T cell exhaustion. We will use a sensitive peptide: major histocompatibility complex II (p:MHCII) tetramer- based cell enrichment method to study the endogenous CD4+ T cell response to a prototypical persistent phagosomal infection caused by ingestion of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimuruim (ST) bacteria to gain insight into how protective CD4+ T cells are generated and function. We will test our idea that presentation of p: MHCII complexes exclusively by infected phagocytes drives the generation of IFN-?-producing Th1 effector cells without generating B cell-dependent follicular helper T cells. We will explore the possibility that infected phagocytes at the site of initial infection produce IL-10, which limis their capacity to clear their infection and prevents terminal differentiation of the Th1 cells, locking them in a state where they retain the capacity to multiple protective phagocyte-activating cytokines. We will determine whether the persistently infected IL-10-producing phagocytes in the mesenteric lymph nodes also stimulate bursts of proliferation by Th1 memory cells that periodically circulate through this site to maintain a stable and functional protective population.  Accomplishing our specific aims with a robust defined in vivo model system could guide vaccine development against this recalcitrant class of pathogens.","2C"

Thus, we now propose a Stage Ib randomized controlled pilot study to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of this approach with a broader group of substance abusers in response to PA-10- 013 issued by NIDA. MAP is a new behavioral intervention that formalizes client-to-client mentorship relationships as an adjunct to standard outpatient substance abuse (SA) treatment. Peer mentorship is a key component of many existing treatment/recovery approaches. Mentor training has tended to be informal not guided by standardized training manuals. Also, 12 Step approaches have been predominant in the U.S. and, while associated with improved outcomes, are not utilized by many patients, in part due to a religious emphasis on reliance on a higher power. MAP is based on Social Learning Theory and is designed to be compatible with a wide range of treatment philosophies to not only address substance abuse, but two significant problems in SA treatment: HIV/Infectious Disease risk behavior and attrition. While there has been a recent dramatic rise in the adoption of alternative forms of peer mentorship programs, most approaches have not been subjected to empirical efficacy testing. MAP is comprised of selection, training, and supervision procedures to enable successful recovering patients to serve as Mentors for clients who are early in the recovery process. Mentoring activities will revolve around assisting Mentees in progressing toward individualized treatment goals and entail 1 hour group mentoring and 1-4 hours of mentoring interaction within/outside of the treatment setting per week starting during the first 30 days of treatment when vulnerability to relapse and drop out is high. Mentors will be offered mentorship training consisting of 1 hour training sessions 2 times  per week for 4 weeks prior to mentoring and supervision provided by professional staff in addition to providing the group and individual mentorship contact to the Mentee. 64 participants (16 Later Recovery Participants/LRP and 48 Early Recovery Participants/ERP) with substance use disorders will be randomized to MAP+TAU or TAU. For participants randomized to MAP, for each cohort, a pool of 4 Mentors will be formed and engage in mentoring activities for 24 weeks until 12 Mentees who are newly admitted have participated in MAP for 12 weeks. LRP must meet lifetime diagnosis for substance abuse or dependence and be 6 months abstinent from drugs and alcohol. ERP must meet current diagnosis for substance abuse or dependence and be actively using substances. Behavioral and biological measures will be conducted at baseline, weekly, monthly, and termination for all participants and during the 12 week follow-up for ERP.","5A"
2013,8431276,"4 R01 AI097051-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The membrane proximal external region (MPER) of HIV gp41 comprises a highly conserved region involved in HIV viral fusion. It is an important target of antibody (Ab)-mediated neutralization as it contains epitopes for two broadly (b) neutralizing (Nt) monoclonal (M) Abs (2F5 and 4E10) and two MAbs that neutralize a significant, but not truly broad, range of HIV isolates (Z13 and m66.6), making the MPER an obvious target for an AIDS vaccine. However, all attempts to produce an MPER-targeting vaccine have failed. Most of these vaccines have been of three types: (i) synthetic peptides; (ii) MPER sequence grafted onto protein scaffolds; or (iii) onto proteins displayed on virus-like particles. In explaiing these failures, we hypothesize that previous vaccines have not faithfully mimicked the neutralization competent structure (NCS) of the MPER. Our preliminary work has shown that the gp41 transmembrane domain (TMD) is required for the full exposure of the MPER, since its replacement with the TMD from another membrane protein, decreases binding by MAb 4E10. Drs. Scott and Lu previously collaborated on producing a DNA vaccine that expresses a gp41 fragment comprising the MPER and TMD, so as to present the MPER in the context of the cell membrane. However, repeated immunization of rabbits with this DNA vaccine elicited low titer Abs that cross-reacted weakly with MPER peptides and did not neutralize virus; boosting immunizations with a virus-like particle vaccine did not improve anti-MPER titers, probably because of low MPER copy number. We propose to design more effective protein-boost immunogens that will mimic the NCS. In specific aim 1 we plan to design liposome and nanoparticle immunogens that present the gp41 MPER+TMD in high copy number in lipid bilayers, so as to better mimic the NCS of the MPER without added proteins that might  distract  the Ab response. We will produce DNA, liposome and nanoparticle candidates that have optimized the: (i) MPER, (ii) TMD, and (iii) composition of the lipid environment, based on relative binding affinity by bNt MAbs, the absence of binding by non-Nt mutants of the bNt MAbs, their behavior in a novel membrane leakage assay, and structural stabilization. In specific aim 2 optimized DNA, liposome and nanoparticle candidates will be produced and tested for their ability to elicit MPER-binding activities and Nt Abs. The optimized liposome and nanoparticle vaccines will then be tested as protein boosts (i.e., following DNA priming) with the goal of maximizing MPER-specific Ab titers and Nt potency and breadth. In addition, antigenicity, immunogenicity and structural data will be used to develop a molecular model of the MPER NCS, which should support future vaccine design.","4B"
2013,8431330,"5 R01 AI052014-11","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infection of a cell by HIV-1 proceeds through a series of steps, each of which defines a potential target for antiviral drug intervention. Current drugs target key viral activities catalyzed by the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase enzymes, but emergence of drug resistance calls for continual development of new drugs with novel modes of action. HIV-1 depends on interactions with numerous cellular proteins as it replicates and maraviroc, a drug that disrupts the interaction between the viral envelope glycoprotein and cellular surface CCR5 receptor, is an approved inhibitor of a virus-cell interaction that blocks the ability of the virus to enter the cell. Also crucial to HIV-1 replicatin is the ability for the preintegration complex intermediate that houses the integrase and reverse transcript to access the chromosomes inside the cell nucleus, where viral DNA integration takes place. Lentiviruses like HIV-1 use an energy-dependent process to transport their preintegration complexes through nuclear pore complexes that riddle the biphasic nuclear envelope, though the molecular mechanisms underlying HIV-1 nuclear transport are poorly understood. Work supported by this renewal grant application identified numerous cellular proteins as potential critical cofactors of HIV-1 replication and a significant number of these, including transportin-3, nucleoporin 153, and nucleoporin 358 were accordingly implicated in preintegration complex nuclear import due to their known functions within the cell. Subsequent work indeed confirmed this contention, though it remains unclear how these and other cellular and viral proteins precisely dictate HIV-1 preintegration complex nuclear import. Using numerous virology, biochemical, and genetic approaches, the work proposed herein will determine the mechanisms of HIV-1 nuclear import, focusing on novel protein interactions between the virus and host cellular components that are essential for the process. Such discoveries will define new targets for the development of inhibitors that block critical HIV-host interactions, which would be expected to increase the breadth of future antiviral armaments in the ongoing battle to control the spread of HIV/AIDS.","2B"
2013,8431439,"5 R01 AI093649-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to understand in greater detail the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis blocks the priming of effective host immunity, with the ultimate goal of using this information to create more effective live vaccine strains. Previous work identified multiple mycobacterial genes involved in blocking apoptosis of infected host cells, which is intimately linked to the ability of the pathogen to prevent presentation of its antigens by MHC class I. Extensive preliminary work has also identified genes in M. tuberculosis that interfere with MHC class II antigen presentation, and genes that block production of key cytokines. A major goal of this proposal is to construct safely attenuated strains of M. tuberculosis in which specific immune evasion genes have been deleted, thus creating more effective vaccines for priming of anti- mycobacterial immunity. The approach involves identifying the most potent anti- apoptotic genes from a group of four candidates that have already been partially characterized, and combining mutations in these with strongly attenuating auxotrophy mutations to eliminate virulence. Precise mutations in the genes of interest will be created using allelic exchange mediated by specialized transducing phages, a methodology that is well established in the laboratory of the PI and his collaborators. The potency of candidate vaccine strains will be further enhanced by incorporating additional mutations in genes that interfere with MHC class II presentation, or with production of IL-12p70 or TNF. Immunological studies of CD4 and CD8 T cell priming by candidate vaccine strains will be carried out in mouse models, allowing identification of the most favorable combinations of specific gene deletions to advance into preclinical vaccination studies in rodents. Studies of the induction of stable T cell memory by candidate vaccine strains will be performed in mice, and the impact of boosting primary responses with mycobacterial proteins will also be initiated. Overall, the proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of the host-pathogen interaction in tuberculosis, and contribute directly to vaccine development for prevention and control of this major human disease.","6D"

Enrollment and retention of participants (including HIV+ women who are not in care) via a regional consortium and generation of complete and high quality data and specimens, 2. The vigorous participation of site investigators in the WIHS scientific process, and 3. Proposal of new aims that address key issues concerning processes and conditions associated with excess morbidity in HIV+ women in the current treatment era. The new aims feature special emphasis on vascular injury and pain and were selected because they concern key morbidities in potent antiretroviral therapy (cART) treated women, involve sex dimorphic  phenomena, and may be influenced by gonadal aging. Vascular measures include indicators of medium (Ankle Brachial Index) and very small vessel condition (measures of retinal vessel caliber). We put forward an increased focus on functional outcomes, including specific organ functional measures, and total physical  fitness and morphology (such as kyphosis). The pain studies take the unique approach of assessing what  participants mean when they report pain, assess genetic contributions and examine outcomes that include  physical function. We also propose to continue our work to measure long term exposure to antiretroviral  drugs (ARVs) using hair samples, which are producing high impact reports concerning the pharmacology of  ARVs in women and continuation of the WIHS Genetics Unit that was recently established in SF WIHS and is  conducting Genome-Wide Association Studies.","1A,1B,1C,3B,5C"
2013,8431729,"5 R01 AI097015-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to  Program Announcement (PA) Number: PA-10-212 issued by the National Insti- tute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), which solicits grant applications from institutions/organizations that propose to develop improved HIV incidence assays with increased specificity and reliability for distinguishing incident from chronic HIV infections.  The stated motivation is to improve the ability to estimate the incidence of HIV infection in order to better control the epidemic. Our proposed method focuses on addressing three important shortcomings associated with current measuring methods: low specificity, low sensitivity and sampling bias. To address these shortcomings, we first introduce a novel entropy measure associated with the viral genome, which will distinguish between recent and long term infections among seropos- itive individuals who test negative on the BED HIV-1 Capture EIA assay, or the best available screening assay. This will increase the overall specificity of the assay. Second, we propose a pooling strategy to lower the cost and increase the accuracy of directly identifying individuals in the critical acute phase of the incidence curve, thus increasing the efficiency and sensitivity of the overall procedure, especially during the period when the anti- body assays have extremely low (or even zero) sensitivity for detecting infection. And third, we propose a way to take advantage of the anonymity afforded by pooled testing to overcome a high non-consent-to-testing rate and its concomitant bias-a non-consent rate that in some studies is sufficiently high to make those survey results suspect. Combining these three proposed advances provides a principled testing method for a cross-sectional estimator of incidence that is cost-effective, timely and reliable. Moreover, in addition to the direct response to the PA we propose a method for estimating the instantaneous incidence curve-rather than a single number-that provides a superior perspective of the progressing epidemic. Because our proposed methods all employ existing technologies in a novel way and do not require any new technological breakthroughs, they offer a high probability of success with only a minimal risk of failure.","1C"
2013,8431730,"5 R21 AI094564-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies proposed in this application will evaluate the adjuvant activity of a natural peptide product when delivered using the needle-free method of intranasal mucosal immunization. We will build upon previous published studies from our group and utilize anthrax recombinant protective antigen (rPA) and a peptide immunogen to evaluate the natural peptide angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) for its ability to provide nasal adjuvant activity for the induction of serum and mucosal antigen-specific humoral and cell- mediate immune responses to include serum IgG, mucosal IgA as well as systemic and mucosal epitope-specific CD8 responses. We will also initiate studies to better define the mechanism of action of this natural peptide adjuvant. Our specific aims are listed below and will utilize a mouse model of nasal immunization to perform early-stage preclinical studies to determine the safety and efficacy of Ang-(1-7) as a nasal vaccine adjuvant when compared to the gold-standard mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin (cholera toxin is not suitable for use in humans due to numerous toxicities). Information learned by the completion of the studies proposed in this application will provide a foundation for the development of a novel, natural peptide for use as an adjuvant for needle-free mucosal vaccines. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Evaluate the nasal adjuvant activity of Ang-(1-7) when nasally delivered with protein or peptide immunogens. Studies performed in this aim will evaluate the adjuvant activity of Ang-(1-7) when nasally delivered with a protein antigen (anthrax protective antigen) or a peptide immunogen (C4-V3 HIV-1 peptide). When using the protein antigen, we will monitor vaccine-induced antigen-specific serum IgG, IgA and IgE responses as well as mucosal IgA. When using the peptide antigen, we will monitor the induction of epitope-specific CD8 responses using IFN3 ELISPOT and tetramer assays. The adjuvant activity of Ang-(1-7) will be compared to control adjuvants cholera toxin and CpG. Aim 2. Perform studies to evaluate the mechanism of action of Ang-(1-7) and its safety when used as a nasal vaccine adjuvant. Ang-(1-7) is known to signal via the MAS receptor. Studies performed in this aim will utilize the MAS antagonist A-779 to determine if the MAS receptor is required for the adjuvant activity of Ang-(1-7) and to determine if the use of Ang-(1-7) influences the cellular composition of the nasal cavity lymphoid tissue after nasal vaccination. Additional studies will evaluate the safety of Ang-(1-7) when used as a nasal vaccine adjuvant.","2C"
2013,8431732,"5 R21 AI100760-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV transmission via breastfeeding accounts for nearly half of the 350,000 infant HIV infections occurring annually. While HIV is readily transmitted from mother-to-child via breastfeeding, it has been recognized both observationally and experimentally that SIV is not or is only rarely transmitted through breastfeeding to infants of natural hosts of SIV. This lack of SIV transmission via breastfeeding is not attributable to low virus RNA load in the breast milk compartment, as maternal milk virus load in nonpathogenic SIV infection is similar to that of HIV and pathogenic SIV infection. Therefore, the infants of natural hosts of SIV are highly exposed, uninfected population, warranting evaluation of the factors contributing to the impediment of virus transmission in this setting. Elucidation of mechanisms that evolved to protect breastfeeding infants of natural hosts of SIV from postnatal SIV infection will inform immunologic strategies to reduce HIV transmission via breastfeeding.  Importantly, we identified robust autologous virus neutralizing antibody response in milk of AGMs. In contrast, an autologous virus neutralization response is not detectable in milk of SIV-infected RMs or HIV-infected women. This effective virus-specific mucosal antibody response in milk of AGMs may impede virus transmission in the infant oral/gastrointestinal tract. Our previous work isolating HIV Envelope-specific monoclonal antibodies from colostrum B cells of HIV-infected women has identified novel HIV Env-specific neutralizing mucosal antibodies produced in the setting of chronic HIV infection. Therefore, identification of SIV Env-specific memory B cell responses in breast milk of nontransmitting natural hosts of SIV will define novel virus-specific mucosal antibody functions that may effectively block of mucosal virus transmission to a highly exposed, uninfected infant population, in contrast to the B cell responses of pathogenic SIV and HIV infection.  This proposal is being submitted in response to the NIAID Program Announcement PA-11-217  Mechanistic Studies of HIV-exposed Seronegative Individuals , specifically addressing the topic of mucosal parameters that are distinctly different in the resistant population (SIV-infected AGM mother- infant pairs) compared to the nonresistant population (SIV-infected RMs and HIV-infected humans mother-infant pairs).","2A"
2013,8431770,"5 R21 AI097664-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent decades have seen a dramatic increase in the incidence of a diverse range of fungal infections, including those of mucosal tissues and life threatening disseminated mycoses. The opportunist Candida albicans is a leading cause of both types of infection. The most widely used antifungal therapies act upon a narrow range of targets within the fungal cell, and have significant limitations including patient toxicity, limited formulations, and/or the development of resistance. The emergence of resistant C. albicans isolates, as well as intrinsically resistant species such as C. glabrata, is a serious medical concern. Thus there is an urgent need for new and improved treatment options. The goal of this proposal is to establish a new class of antifungal agents which act via a distinct mechanism from existing therapies. We will also begin to assess the potential of these agents as clinically applicable treatments. Our studies have demonstrated that disruption of the fungal vacuole renders C. albicans highly susceptible to host phagocytic cells, unable to invade mucosal tissue, and avirulent in a mouse model of disseminated infection. Similar studies have shown that the vacuole is essential for Cryptococcus neoformans to colonize and cause disease in a mouse model of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. Therefore, the lack of an equivalent organelle in mammalian cells makes the vacuole an attractive intervention point to selectively disrupt fungal pathogenesis. We have devised an efficient high through-put method to identify small molecules which disrupt the integrity of the C. albicans vacuole. This will be used to screen a library of 50,000 'drug like' compounds. Preliminary data has established an expected 'hit rate' of 0.1-0.4%, thus we anticipate identifying 50-200 vacuole disrupting compounds. We will then progressively select those with the greatest potential for future clinical application. This will involve eliminating those which are toxic to mammalian cells, and confirming that each agent reduces the pathogenic potential of C. albicans. All fungi possess a vacuole; thus, in order to assess the 'broad spectrum' potential of each vacuole disrupting agent, we will test for activity against other infectious fungi including C. neoformans. The long-term goal will be to advance this new generation of antifungal agents towards clinical trials.","6D"
2013,8431950,"2 R01 AI064909-06A1","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CD8 T cells are critical constituents of the cell-mediated branch of the adaptive immune response, whose extensive study has revealed life cycle phases from naive surveillance to effector expansion, effector contraction, and ultimately memory maintenance. The molecular processes that regulate each of these phases are of great interest and are now beginning to be understood. One area of specific interest is the regulation of cellular metabolism as T cells transition from anabolism during expansion to catabolic restrictions during contraction. During the current funding period, we have found that CD8 T cells lacking the adapter protein TRAF6 mount a normal primary response to bacterial infection, but then undergo hyper-contraction, resulting in profoundly deficient T cell memory. Intriguingly, we were able to link this defect to a previously unrecognized requirement for induction of metabolic fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Therefore, in this competing renewal application, we propose to further examine the link(s) between TRAF6, FAO, and CD8 T cell memory, and to determine whether, and in what way, these relationships are shaped by external factors encountered by T cells during immune responses. We will do so by pursuing two broad specific aims: (1) Characterize the relationship between TRAF6, FAO, and CD8 T cell memory: We propose examining further the effect of TRAF6 deficiency on memory development and maintenance by employing models which allow for temporally-modulated deletion of TRAF6. We will also dissect the relationship balancing FAO induction per se against broader regulation of cell survival during contraction. Having indirectly linked FAO and memory via TRAF6, we now propose to determine whether specific, genetically targeted, enhancement of FAO positively affects memory formation in otherwise normal cells and/or rescues memory in TRAF6-deficient cells. (2) Assess the effects of extrinsic factors on TRAF6-dependent FAO induction and CD8 T memory: Our preliminary data suggest that TRAF6-deficient CD8 T cells possess differential capacity to develop memory in response to a model bacterial versus viral infection, and remarkably, that treatment with the virus-associated TLR ligand Poly I:C can (at least partially) rescue the TRAF6-associated CD8 T cell memory defect. Because of the relationship we have uncovered between TRAF6, CD8 T cell memory, and FAO, we will examine how external (e.g., Poly I:C and the closely associated cytokine Type I IFN) and internal (i.e., FAO) T cell memory-related factors reach a molecular intersection at TRAF6. This final component will be probed through complementary bioinformatic and biochemical approaches. All together, the studies proposed herein should greatly improve contextualization of our exciting finding that TRAF6 and metabolism are linked in a manner critical to CD8 T memory formation, and should provide significant advances in our understanding of the cell-intrinsic processes that drive memory cell development in response to different types of infections, findings of potentially considerable value to future vaccine design.","2C"
2013,8431983,"1 R01 HD074925-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To realize the benefits of HIV care requires high medication adherence that has been found lower than previously assumed and declining over time in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Youths with still developing emotional and cognitive capacities face special and unique challenges to adherence. Despite a wealth of interventions designed to increase adherence outcomes, few have focused on the period of adolescence. Developing ways to increase adherence rates among adolescents is particularly important as this group experiences the fastest growth in new HIV/AIDS cases. Such interventions are important in resource-limited settings important where second-line therapy is often too expensive or altogether unavailable. Similarly, youths are often on pre-ART co-trimoxazole prophylaxis to defer the need to take costly ART, yet most interventions do not take this reality into account. The recent rapid rise in mobile phone coverage and ownership among developing country populations has spawned the advent of mobile-phone based interventions to improve health service delivery; short message service (SMS)-based interventions have been found to increase adherence rates to ART among adult patients, yet their effectiveness among an adolescent population remains unknown. Such interventions are likely particularly effective for adolescents who have been central to the rapid growth in mobile phone ownership in developing countries. This proposal suggests to develop and test potentially cost-effective and scalable short message service (SMS)-based interventions to improve adherence to ART and pre-ART prophylaxis, as well as retention in care among HIV positive young patients aged 15-24 at two clinics in Uganda. The first aim is to hold focus groups with key stakeholders to tailor the SMS-intervention to the local needs of youths. The second aim proposed is a two-year randomized controlled trial testing one- way and two-way SMS messages (the latter offer the possibility for clients to signal health problems for follow-up by clinic staff) against a control condition of usual care to determine which method of reminding and motivating drug adherence can best achieve its goals, and whether the potentially higher adherence achieved in the two-way messages justify their increased cost. The third aim is to synthesize lessons learned and discuss them with the clinics and other key stakeholders. A cost-effectiveness analysis of one- versus two-way messages will also be performed as part of this aim.","5B,5C,8B"
2013,8431996,"5 R21 AI097097-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been estimated that one-third of the global population (total of ~2 billion) is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). A majority of those infected (90%) will never contract active TB and will remain asymptomatic. In immunocompromised patients, however, TB is a major cause of death worldwide. For example, TB is the leading cause of death in HIV-positive patients. The World Health Organization estimates that 9 million people contracted active TB in 2006 (~6 million from Southeast Asia and Africa alone) and over 1 million died from the disease. Another 10 million are projected to acquire the disease this year, the most in history. Many TB diagnostic assays are on the market or in development. A majority, however, are not well suited for operation in resource-limited settings. Collectively they are too expensive, too time consuming (24 hrs or more), require specialized equipment, expertise, and power, have low sensitivities (50% in the sputum smear test), or do not work on HIV-positive patients or children (antigen tests). It has been estimated that more rapid and accurate TB diagnostic methods would save 400,000 lives per year. The long-term goal of this research is to develop new infectious disease diagnostic assays that can be deployed in resource-limited settings. We seek to develop assays that can be performed outside of a laboratory setting, that is, without PCR amplification, and with minimal power, instrumentation, and scientific expertise. We propose to accomplish this goal by combining two technologies developed at CU-Boulder-modified DNA aptamers and  materials DNAzymes -with a conductance-based chip platform. Modified DNA aptamers have proven to have affinities and specificities for protein targets that are as good as or better than antibodies. Compared to antibodies, however, DNA aptamers require less time and cost to discover and produce, and are more thermally stable. Materials DNAzymes are DNA sequences that convert otherwise stable metal complex precursors into metal nanoparticles. This application describes the use of modified DNA aptamer/materials DNAzyme conjugates (materials aptazymes) for the electrical detection of TB lipoarabinomannan (LAM) from urine. The Specific Aims for the project are as follows. Aim 1 (Months 1-6). Isolate modified DNA aptamers for TB LAM. Aim 2 (1-6 months). Isolate materials DNAzymes that mediate the formation of Au nanoparticles from solutions containing [Au(Cl)4]1-. Aim 3 (Months 6-12). Synthesize a chimera containing a TB DNA aptamer and Au DNAzyme and verify that each sequence functions properly. Aim 4 (Months 12-24). Determine detection limits and specificities of TB LAM in simulated urine. Upon completion of these aims, we will be poised to use the reagents and technology developed in this project in an RO1 project that will validate LAM in urine as a biomarker of TB infection.","6D"

Existing interventions for reducing HIV risk have had limited efficacy in drug-dependent sex workers, and criminal justice approaches have been ineffective despite their high cost. A potentially ideal alternative is to divert drug-dependet arrestees from prosecution to a treatment that reduces drug use and HIV sex risk behaviors, while providing job skills training and promoting community employment to alleviate the financial need to continue sex work. In order to provide an effective therapeutic alternative to criminal prosecution, we propose to develop a multifaceted intervention that includes methadone treatment and the Therapeutic Workplace. The Therapeutic Workplace is a supported environment in which participants are required to provide drug-free urine samples to access paid job skills training or employment and to maintain the maximum rate of pay. The overall intervention is designed to reduce drug use and HIV risk behaviors, and simultaneously promote employment. The proposed project is a 2-year Stage I behavior therapy development effort that will include the development, manualization and pilot testing of a Therapeutic Workplace intervention tailored to drug- dependent adults arrested for prostitution. In the pilot study, we wll recruit opiate- and cocaine-dependent adults arrested for prostitution from the Eastside District Court in Baltimore. Eligible individuals will be offered methadone treatment in lieu of prosecution and will be required to remain in methadone treatment for 90 days to have the charges against them dropped. After enrolling in methadone treatment, the diverted individuals will be invited to participate in the pilot study. Interested individuals will be randomly assigned to receive the standard methadone treatment services or these services plus the Therapeutic Workplace. The Therapeutic Workplace has two phases. In Phase 1, participants will be offered four months of stipend-supported job training in the Therapeutic Workplace. In Phase 2, participants will be encouraged to seek employment in a community job and will receive wage subsidies for four months for maintaining community employment or engaging in supervised job seeking. Throughout both phases, participants will be required to provide drug-free urine samples to receive Therapeutic Workplace wages (training stipends in Phase 1 and wage subsidies in Phase 2). The wage subsidy program will include drug testing managed by a national supplier of drug-free workplace services. Overall, this treatment could serve as a novel and ideal intervention for drug-dependent adults arrested for prostitution while reducing criminal justice costs.","5A"

Most importantly, I will have the opportunity to work with a national, NIH-funded, multi-center cohort study in which I will have the primary role in the implementation of an independent substudy as well as a leading role in developing future studies in the field of HIV-associated metabolic disease and mitochondrial dysfunction. Environment: Children's Hospital Boston and Harvard School of Public Health are known for their world- renowned faculty, several of whom will serve as mentors and advisors for me and my project, an established Clinical Research Program which provides support for clinical investigators in all aspects of grant and protocol development and implementation, a General Clinical Research Center/Clinical Translational Study Unit, the NIH-funded pan-university,collaborative Harvard Catalyst Program for the establishment of a Clinical and Translational Science Center, and a wide array of educational seminars and training programs designed specifically for faculty who are conducting clinical research. Research: My research endeavor addresses a newly emerging challenge that we face in HIV care - potential adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Metabolic complications such insulin resistance and lipid abnormalities are risk factors of premature myocardial infarction, and there is increasing evidence that the mechanism for these metabolic complications, especially insulin resistance, may be mitochondrial dysfunction. Preliminary studies in HIV-infected children indicate that 14% of these children already exhibit insulin resistance by the time they are adolescents. Studies in HIV-infected adults demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in conjunction with ART and that individuals with mitochondrial abnormalities are more likely to have insulin resistance. Our aims are to first characterize body composition abnormalities, nutritional issues, and metabolic complications in HIV-infected children by analyzing a large, existing database of diet, anthropometric measures, laboratory studies (lipid profiles, glucose, insulin) and DEXA scans that have been collected in HIV-infected children over a 19-year period. We will then conduct a national, multi-center study in collaboration with the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) to determine whether mitochondrial dysfunction and hyperlactatemia are associated with insulin resistance or specific antiretroviral agents. For this second Aim over 400 HIV-infected children as well as controls will be enrolled, and PBMC and buccal swab assays to detect mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation abnormalities and evidence of oxidative stress will be conducted.","6C,6E,6J"

Antiretroviral (ART) adherence is a global health priority, but Rwandan youth are more than twice as likely to be on second line therapy as adults, and with a median population age of 18.7 years old, adherence is essential for Rwanda's future. Resources to provide youth-centered medical and psychosocial care are limited in Rwanda, and young people with HIV face many obstacles to adherence, namely the long-term consequences of genocide, depression, and gender-based violence, as well as logistical issues, negative attitudes, and insufficient parent/caregiver support. Preliminary data underscore the utility of culturally-adapted, trauma-informed cognitive behavioral therapy (TI-CBT) in reducing depression and traumatic distress among youth and adults in Rwanda. This project proposes a 2-arm RCT to test and compare the efficacy of adherence-enhanced TI-CBT (i.e., TI-CBTe) to usual care in increasing ART adherence among 350 Rwandan 14 - 21 year olds from the two clinics caring for the largest number of youth with HIV in Rwanda. Based on the Indigenous Leader Outreach Model, we will train 20 HIV+ indigenous youth leaders who are > 95% ART adherent (IYL) and supervising psychologists to deliver the intervention. Youth, caregivers, and IYL will complete baseline, 6-, and 12-month follow-up assessments to assess effects on adherence and important mediators (trauma, depression, gender-based violence). We will use an intent-to-treat analysis and a combination of regression techniques and other inferential statistical tests for contrasting means and proportions. We will analyze treatment outcomes using logistic and linear multiple regression models examining effects at 6- and 12- months separately, as well as a combined model with random effects for repeated measurements across time. This proposal answers a compelling need for innovative programs to increase ART adherence among HIV+ youth. If effective, the study will build Rwanda's capacity to provide much needed services; and, involvement by the Rwanda Biomedical Center will ensure wide dissemination.","5B,5C"
2013,8432236,"1 R01 AT007888-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite remarkable advances in HIV medication effectiveness, adherence to treatment recommendations among HIV-infected youth is alarmingly poor, resulting in preventable morbidity and mortality. Most current HIV treatment adherence interventions are designed to change thoughts and behaviors, but have limited effect on improving HIV medication adherence. Successful medication adherence relies on individuals' on-going self-regulation, an intertwined process involving coping, psychological function, and cognitive function. In this application, we propose to study the ability of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) to improve HIV-infected youth's HIV medication adherence and self-regulation. MBSR is a program of meditation techniques to enhance participants' mindfulness, or present-focused, non-judgmental awareness. Our previous research in urban youth shows that MBSR improves health-related behaviors and self-regulation. Further, preliminary data from our R21 on MBSR for stress-reduction in HIV-infected youth suggest an association between mindfulness and improved medication adherence, as well as enhanced self-regulatory processes (coping, psychological function, and cognitive function). This intervention is innovative and significant because it focuses on self-regulatory processes, and it may be used alone or as a complement to current interventions addressing specific behaviors.  Building on the promising, but preliminary, findings of our R21 pilot study, this RCT will determine the effect  of MBSR on HIV medication adherence (Aim 1) and self-regulation (Aim 2) among HIV-infected youth.  To achieve these aims, our experienced, collaborative team will conduct a full-scale, two-site RCT with 162 HIV-infected youth 13-24 years old, comparing 1) MBSR, 2) an active control (health education program), and 3) usual care. We will determine whether group assignment predicts outcomes of interest. We will also explore: 1) associations (and potential mediation) among mindfulness, self-regulation, and medication adherence and 2) using qualitative methods, reasons for non/low-participation to inform future implementation planning. While medication adherence is our primary adherence outcome, we will also look at other HIV treatment behaviors of appointment-keeping and sex behavior. Additionally, we will employ an innovative approach to use 2 potentially-complementary methods of medication adherence data collection.","5A"
2013,8432444,"5 R21 AI100590-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for an exploratory research grant to identify new forms of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) non- structural proteins produced in infected human liver tissue and to develop models for their formation and function. HCV continues to be a significant public-health concern of global proportion. In spite of years of effot, the inability to study the numerous genotypes of HCV in cell culture remains an obstacle to our understanding of the mechanisms employed by this virus to establish persistence, which can ultimately lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCV non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) is unique among non-structural proteins of most positive-strand RNA viruses. Two of its three domains are intrinsically disordered, and it contains numerous sites of phosphorylation for myriad serine/threonine kinases, including cAMP-activated protein kinase (PKA), casein kinase 1 family members and casein kinase 2. We have been intrigued by the possibility that specific patterns of NS5A phosphorylation produce unique conformations and functions for this protein, thus explaining the ability of NS5A to interact with so many cellular proteins and pathways. Our experimental tests of this possibility have led to the identification of the site of NS5A phosphorylation by PKA and to the development of immunological reagents to demonstrate the existence of the PKA-phosphorylated form of NS5A in cells replicating HCV RNA of both genotypes 1b and 2a. In addition, examination of biopsies from pediatric cases of hepatitis C and tissue from an end-stage case of hepatitis C, led to the discovery that forms of NS5A observed in infected liver tissue are different than those observed in human hepatoma cell lines replicating HCV RNA. The additional forms of NS5A detected in liver tissue are remarkably similar to those observed in cell lines when caspases are activated and the abundance of the PKA- phosphorylated species correlates well with the amount of liver injury. It is our hypothesis that caspase cleavage of NS5A could provide a mechanism for HCV to monitor the antiviral state of the hepatocyte; phosphorylation of NS5A could signal to HCV that an anti-apoptotic state suitable for replication exists in the hepatocyte. These cleaved and phosphorylated forms may expand the NS5A proteome, creating forms of the protein essential for virus multiplication. If this is the case, then the inability of most HCV sequences to replicat in hepatoma cell lines may be related, in part, to the inability to produce forms of NS5A, and perhaps other non-structural proteins, that are readily produced in hepatocytes and that are required for optimal virus multiplication. Our working model will be explored by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Identification and characterization of forms of HCV non-structural proteins produced during infection in vivo; (2) Evaluation of pro-apoptotic and pro-survival (anti-apoptotic) responses during HCV infection in vivo; and (3) Elucidation of clinical correlations. These studies have the ability to discover forms of HCV non-structural proteins unique to the infected hepatocyte and to reveal correlations between the level of these new forms and clinical outcomes.","2D"
2013,8432453,"5 R01 MH087247-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 associated neuropathogenesis is characterized by two distinct observations. The first concerns the notable cognitive and motor dysfunction in HIV-1 infected individuals. The second relates to the lack of infection of neurons by HIV-1. This suggests that the dementia in AIDS patients might be the result of a combination of both direct and indirect effects of HIV-1 encoded proteins (Env, Tat, Nef and Vpr) and host cellular factors. The mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of dementia are poorly understood. The goal of this application is to elucidate the contribution of HIV-1 Vpr to neuropathogenesis. In the infected individuals, Vpr is present in cell-associated, virion-associated and cell and virion-free forms. Further, the ability to traverse through cell membrane endows Vpr the potential to cause damage directly in uninfected bystanders such as neurons. Furthermore, Vpr is also known to indirectly dysregulate bystander cells through cellular factors released from infected target cells. Based on this, we hypothesize that Vpr has the potential to contribute to neuronal apoptosis and dysfunction. To elucidate the molecular events underlying dementia, we propose to analyze the effects of Vpr using appropriate human primary cells in culture as a model. To achieve these goals we propose to: (i) determine the mechanism(s) involved in Vpr mediated neuronal loss and dysfunction directly; (ii) identify the cellular cofactors and neuroinflammatory molecules differentially regulated by Vpr in target cells; and (iii) identify the structure-function relation of Vpr to neuropathogenesis using naturally occurring Vpr variants from CNS compartment.","2G"
2013,8432485,"5 R34 MH094188-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interpersonal violence (IV) and HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (HIV/STIs) are frequent and interconnected public health problems facing women, especially incarcerated women. Incarcerated women are of public health concern because they have extremely high rates of lifetime IV and they are extremely likely to engage in behaviors which place them and others at risk for HIV/STI infection as they re-enter the community. Furthermore, psychopathology and impairment related to interpersonal violence exposure, in particular affect dysregulation and social dysfunction, may further compromise HIV safety behaviors in women who have experienced interpersonal violence. To date, no interventions have been developed or tested to address the needs of incarcerated women with lifetime IV, which include the challenges of addressing violence-related deficits (poor affect modulation and poor social support) within the context of sexual safety, sexual safety with violent partners, and maintaining sexual and personal safety in the context of the stresses of community re-integration. The empirically supported Women's CoOp HIV prevention intervention (WC) has been successful in reducing sex risk, violent victimization, substance use, and homelessness in other populations of high-risk women; key concerns in the lives of incarcerated women who have experienced violence, especially in their transition to the community. Our study proposes to tailor WC for the context of incarcerated women with lifetime IV and then integrate it with novel intervention components (i.e., skills to increase affect modulation and social support) to maintain sexual safety. More specifically, the purposes of this R34 Exploratory Research Project are to (a) integrate strategies for affect management and increased social support/access to community resources into WC and tailor the integrated intervention for incarcerated women with lifetime interpersonal violence, and (b) conduct a randomized pilot trial in a sample of 40 incarcerated women with IV to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed recruitment methods and research design, of the therapist training methods and of delivering the proposed intervention, which will lay the groundwork for future R01 clinical trials. We will also explore confidence intervals around preliminary differences between the enhanced WC intervention and a dose-matched control condition (Nutrition Program) on the following outcomes through 8 months post prison release: reduced unprotected vaginal or anal sex occasions and fewer cases of vaginal trichomoniasis (primary); reduced interpersonal violence episodes, symptoms of PTSD and depression, and drug using/heavy drinking days (secondary); and increased affect management and social support (including effectiveness in obtaining substance use, mental health treatment and other resources) (tertiary). If the proposed intervention is found to be efficacious in our vulnerable target population, we anticipate that it could have significant implications for HIV/STI prevention efforts for a more heterogeneous population of individuals who have experienced interpersonal violence.","5A"
2013,8432491,"5 R37 AI038518-19","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV prevention efforts, including vaccine, microbicide and co-infection prophylaxis strategies, have yielded disappointing results, highlighting the need for new concepts. To this end, a better understanding of early events in HIV infection, including HIV acquisition in the face of an existing HIV infection (superinfection) are needed. Superinfection, in particular, offers an opportunity to examine immune correlates of protection based on responses to the initial infection. Our research team is in unique position to address such questions because we have developed and maintained a cohort of ~ 2000 women at high-risk of HIV infection for the past 15 years. This cohort includes more than 300 women who have known dates of HIV infection and who have been followed closely, including regular sample collection for a median of 4.4 years after their infection. Importantly, 12 cases of superinfection were identified in the first 56 women examined in this cohort, including both intra and intersubtype re-infections. Here we propose to continue monitoring this unique cohort and leveraging existing samples to examine factors that influence early virus control and the incidence of superinfection and its correlates. Specifically, we propose to examine the role of early humoral immune responses, particularly antibodies that contribute to Fc-mediated antibody activity, in viral control and disease progression. We propose to examine the role of these same immune parameters in cases of superinfection to determine if there are deficits in humoral immunity in those who become superinfected. A major emphasis of our studies will be in determining whether a first HIV infection provides any protection from a second infection by determining if the incidence of superinfection is lower that the incidence of initial infection. We propose to examine whether there are cases of transient superinfection, and if so, whether antibody responses may play a role in viral control in this setting. Together, these studies will provide critical data on the role of Fc-mediated antibody activity in defining early virus control and subsequent disease as well as their potential role in protection from infection.","1A,2C"
2013,8432494,"5 F31 MH087226-04","Despite their disproportionate vulnerability to HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV), incarcerated women are rarely the focus of prevention research. At risk women can be difficult to reach in the community; so prison provides a unique opportunity to gain access to women while they have the time available to engage in prevention programming and are not preoccupied by other immediate needs (e.g. childcare, shelter, next meal, drug acquisition). Since the vast majority of women in prison will soon return to their communities (Travis, 2005), their elevated infection rates also carry serious public health implications. Recent meta-analyses of interventions in HIV prevention have demonstrated that current risk behavior models must be adapted to effectively fit the needs of distinct populations. Since very little research has been conducted with incarcerated women, formative research is needed to establish which factors are most influential in their risk behavior so that these factors can be targeted through interventions. The proposed research involves a mixed-methods study to evaluate a model of risk behavior among incarcerated women based on Social Action Theory (SAT). Expanding upon classic social-cognitive theories, SAT emphasizes two major components: (1) the dynamic health action state; and (2) the self-change process; and incorporates contextual factors like interpersonal dynamics and internal affective states. In the current study, qualitative in-depth interviews with incarcerated women (N = 20) will be used to examine the dynamic health action state, which includes interdependence with a sexual partner and experienced consequences of action taken. Quantitative data collected in structured surveys with incarcerated women (N = 200) will be used to test the self-change process, specifically looking at pathways that incorporate the impact of established cognitive predictors of risk behavior, as well as intimate relationship control and psychological distress, on sexual risk-taking. This study will be the first step in a program of research ultimately leading to the design of a comprehensive intervention that integrates mental health treatment and risk prevention to be administered within correctional settings. The applicant, a top student at the #1 clinical psychology program in the country, has already obtained the support of prison and state department administrators. She has also assembled a team of experts who have devised a comprehensive training plan for the applicant, and are eager to assist in achieving the fellowship goals.","7A"

The HIV epidemic in Peru remains concentrated within the core risk group of MSM. STI infection and re-infection are central to the continuation of the HIV epidemic among MSM in Peru. Development of improved strategies for partner notification and treatment will reduce the incidence and prevalence of STIs and ultimately reduce the incidence of HIV infection in this population. Specific Aim 1: To explore the influence of behavioral, sociocultural, and clinical aspects of STI transmission on partner notification attitudes and practices among MSM in urban Peru. Specific Aim 1a. To develop a quantitative survey for the assessment of behavioral, sociocultural, and biomedical factors influencing partner notification decisions among MSM in Peru. Specific Aim 1b. To use quantitative methods to assess behavioral, sociocultural, and biomedical factors influencing partner notification decisions among MSM in Peru. Specific Aim 2: To assess the efficacy of internet- and referral card-based partner notification tools for the improvement of partner notification outcomes among MSM in Lima, Peru. The intervention is tailored to address key aspects of Peru's social and epidemiologic environment, including high rates of internet use, underdeveloped community formation among MSM, and circular patterns of HIV and STI transmission within MSM sexual networks. As a result, the proposed research manipulates existing mechanisms and patterns of interaction for the spread of HIV/STIs among MSM to design innovative, cost-effective systems of partner notification for the prevention of STI and HIV transmission in Peru.    PUBLI HEALTH RELEVANCE: Partner notification and treatment are critical, unresolved aspects of HIV and STI control in both developed and developing regions. The strategies assessed here, while organic to the specific needs of the HIV epidemic in Latin America, will be applicable to a wide range of global settings to increase control of STIs and prevent the transmission of HIV infection.","5A"
2013,8432501,"5 R01 AI063987-09","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Some mammals, including primates, express dominant restriction factors that block the infection of certain retroviruses during the early phase of virus replication. TRIM51 or, in some species, a TRIM5- cyclophilin A fusion protein called TRIMCyp, mediates these early blocks by binding the retroviral capsid as it enters the host cell cytoplasm. TRIM51 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins and contains RING, B-box 2, coiled coil and B30.2/SPRY domains. The coiled coil contributes to TRIM51 dimerization; the B30.2/SPRY domain contributes to capsid recognition. The functions of the RING and B-box 2 domains in TRIM51-mediated retroviral restriction are less well understood. These domains contribute to the potency of retrovirus restriction, which is thought to involve the accelerated uncoating the viral capsid. The overall goal of this competing renewal application is to understand the molecular mechanism of TRIM51- mediated retrovirus restriction and to define the roles of individual TRIM51 domains and capsid elements in virus recognition and inhibition. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To investigate the role of the TRIM51 B-box 2 domain in retrovirus restriction; 2) To investigate the contribution of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the TRIM51 RING domain to retrovirus restriction; 3) To test mechanistic models of TRIM51-mediated retrovirus restriction; and 4) To define how changes in the retroviral capsid influence interaction with TRIM51 and host cell cofactors such as cyclophilin A.","2B"
2013,8432508,"5 P60 DA011015-15","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This revised proposal requests continued support for a Comprehensive P60 Center to extend our study of antisocial drug dependence to encompass its implications for HIV/AIDS. The overall goal of this competitive renewal application is to contribute to our understanding of the etiology of individual differences in behavioral disinhibition, the relationship of this to drug abuse and the development of dependence, and the role that these play in the propensity for risky behaviors that may result in STDs, including HIV/AIDS. Our unique focus has been the contribution of genetics, both through linkage and association studies, and biometrical behavior genetic studies. Our overall thesis is that: Most new American HIV infections occur when adolescents or adults choose to engage in unprotected sexual behaviors or drug behaviors well known to be dangerous. Identifiable genes of some persons produce a lifelong behavioral disposition that involves excessive pursuit of exciting appetitive stimuli and unusual disregard of aversive consequences for behavior, a  behavioral disinhibition . These characteristics frequently lead to substance abuse or dependence, antisocial behavior, and engagement in risky behaviors. Eventually, specification of the genetic and environmental factors influencing this behavioral disposition will lead to improved therapies that may reduce the vulnerability to engage in substance abuse, antisocial behavior, and risky behavior. In pursuit of this thesis we propose the following studies: 1) to identify specific genetic loci that influence behavioral disinhibition, we will conduct a genome-wide association study on an existing sample of 1000 adolescent cases and 1000 controls with Substance Dependence, Conduct Disorder, and HIV-related risk behaviors, and a newly ascertained sample of 600 adolescents recruited from adolescent substance abuse treatment programs and a control sample of 600 adolescents without serious substance or behavioral problems. 2) We will collect a third assessment in young adulthood on the clinical families and community family and twin samples participating in the Center, with detailed assessments of HIV risk behaviors. 3) We will conduct brain imaging studies to explore a neural basis for risky behaviors in disinhibited individuals, and explore the association of SNPs identified in '1' with activation of brain regions of interest, and 4) we will conduct a series of pilot studies of innovative approaches to the genetics of HIV risk behaviors. These projects will be supported by cores providing: A) Administrative, Educational, and Ethics support; B) Data management, informatics, and biostatistics; C) Genotyping and molecular genetics.","1A"

Sheps Center for Health Services Research. We propose to rapidly establish the UNC-WIHS cohort, contribute meaningfully to the national WIHS scientific program, and undertake an ambitious HIV research agenda that encompasses social epidemiology and health outcomes, advanced epidemiologic and biostatistical methods, pathogenesis, and molecular biology of cancer. We aim to: 1) Recruit and retain in follow-up a cohort of 200 HIV+ and 100 HIV- women who are at high risk for HIV infection and represent NC's HIV epidemic, thus expanding the WIHS Cohort to women who live in a region at the forefront of the US epidemic; 2) Characterize the relationship between socioeconomic context, changes in access to health insurance, and health outcomes among HIV+ and HIV- women; 3) Develop and apply novel epidemiologic and statistical methods using data from the UNC-WIHS and the entire WIHS cohort; 4) Characterize HIV persistence in the blood and genital tract among pre- and post-menopausal women; and 5) Investigate the pathobiology of breast and cervical cancers to identify immunological, microbial and genetic factors that affect cancer progression and treatment in HIV positive women. By contributing a diverse and complementary population of women, innovative science, and a strong, multidisciplinary cadre of investigators, UNC will enhance the efforts of the WIHS, expand the range of questions that can be addressed and, in collaboration with the entire group, improve the health of HIV+ women and women at high risk for HIV infection.","1A,1B,1C,2C,2E,2F,2G,5B,5C"
2013,8432608,"5 F32 AI098308-02","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV requires host machinery to replicate. In turn, the host cell protects itself using antiviral factors. A full understanding of the host factors involve in HIV replication will provide us with valuable knowledge of HIV virology and cell biology. It will also help to develop new anti-HIV therapy. Functional screens using genome-wide siRNA libraries have implicated hundreds of host proteins as modulators of HIV replication. In this proposed project, we will use multiple RNAi resources to identify the innate host proteins that restrict HIV-1 replication. The remaining goals for this project are to focus on further validation  and functional study of the restriction factors that come out of screens. Aim 1 is the validation and functional analysis of HIV-1 restriction factors identified through genome-wide siRNA screens. We recently completed siRNA screens using multiple RNAi resources (three orthologous siRNA libraries). The screens identified 212 potential host restriction factors. For this aim, we plan to focus on a shortened list of potential anti-HIV host factors, and perform further validation and functional studies to confirm their roles. The plan includes confirmation of  siRNA knockdown efficacy, RNAi effect rescue, validation in human primary cells, and mechanistic studies of a few of promising HIV-1 restriction factors. In addition, we plan to test the inhibitory efforts of confirmed restriction factors on other viruses. Aim 2 is the identificatin of factors that mediate interferon- induced restriction of HIV-1 through genome-wide siRNA screens. It has been long known that Type I interferon (IFN) can induce the expression of a large set of interferon-stimulated genes and establish a potent antiviral response. Both early and late steps of HIV-1 replication can be blocked by IFN-1. In this aim, we will perform genome-wide siRNA screens to identify HIV-1 restriction factors whose activity is required by IFN. The candidate restriction factors will be further filtered by performing comprehensive bioinformatic analysis. A set of potential IFN-induced HIV-1 restriction factors will be selected for further validation and functional studies. We believe that our study of HIV-1 restriction factors will provide new insights into the barriers to viral infection and may have important ramifications for the identification of new antiviral targets.","7A"

African American women continue to bear the largest burden of HIV disease among women, with disproportionately higher rates of new HIV infections, AIDS diagnoses, and mortality. The major goal of this proposal is to continue the high level of productivity of the Chicago WIHS Consortium (CWC) as both a clinical research site and as a consortium of scientific leaders with a track record of advancing our understanding of the evolving HIV epidemic in US women. We will continue to rapidly recruit and retain a representative cohort of women with and at risk for HIV, to collect th highest quality data in order to lead and pursue innovative epidemiologic analyses, and multidisciplinary investigations to characterize treated HIV disease in women. Over the WIHS-V five year period, we will continue to design, implement, synthesize, and disseminate findings from investigations which explore the dynamic and complex relationships between HIV, ART, viral suppression, sociodemographics, behaviors, mental illness, immune biomarkers, menopausal stage, and comorbidities rather than focusing on the impact of any one single factor. The CWC investigative team proposes to expand and retain the Chicago cohort and to apply analytic modeling to longitudinal social/behavioral, clinical, neurocognitive, and pathogenesis data to develop and test a gender specific prognostic index ( WIHS Index ). We aim to identify psychological, neuroendocrine, genetic, and immunologic predictors of HIV disease phenotypes, including those characterized by inflammation, activation, and cellular senescence and determine the association with clinical and pre-clinical measures of HIV associated non AIDS (HANA) co-morbidities. Since evidence suggests that potentially modifiable factors, such as untreated mental illness, chronic life stress, and use of addictive substances can contribute to inflammation and accelerate telomere shortening, a key molecular marker of cellular senescence, we will explore the interactions between psychiatric diagnoses, hormonal patterns, and markers of the innate and adaptive immune system. Given the high rates of these modifiable factors in our cohort, we propose a multi-site randomized controlled trial to test an evidence based computerized tailored intervention based on the Transtheoretical Model to address risk behaviors concurrently aimed at smoking cessation, improving ART adherence, and effectively managing stress, depression, and weight. Through these WIHS V efforts, we hope to identify new tools that can be used at all levels of HIV care (community, clinic, and laboratory) to empower clinicians and their female patients to improve the prognosis and lives of women with HIV.","1A,1B,1C,2B,2G,5A,5C"

Effective  primary prevention through microbicides, pre-exposure prophylaxis and treatment of persons living with HIV (PLWH) seems within our reach. Equally important, basic science advances suggest that cure is possible through activation and/or elimination of HIV proviral DNA from host cells. We propose a WIHS scientific agenda that informs these possible routes to defeating HIV, through investigations of genital tract innate immune factors protecting against HIV-infection; identification of epigenetic changes in the provirus that may define a target for cure; and elucidating cell-to-cell viral transfer. We will continue to use WIHS's robust database to inform effective treatment for women and persons of African descent. Of the 34.0 million PLWH globally more than half of are women, and more than 75% are of African ancestry; nearly all studies of the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are in men of European descent. Thus, epidemiologic and translational investigation of population- based effectiveness of ART in WIHS, which is 100% women and >60% of African descent, will provide critical information for patients and providers both in the US and globally. Further, with 18 years of prospective data collection the WIHS is able to investigate clinical manifestations in aging populations, including studies of changes in the genital tract with reproductive aging. The Bronx WIHS has provided both operational excellence and scientific leadership nationally since WIHS's inception in 1993. In WIHS V we will continue to lead the WIHS-wide investigations in HPV and cervical neoplasia; cardiovascular disease and inflammation; genital tract mucosal immunology and virology; immunogenetics; HIV virology; musculoskeletal manifestations of HIV disease; and host characteristics influencing population based effectiveness of ART. We will also continue our excellent operational performance in providing high volume, complete, high quality data both for the WIHS core activities, and all substudies.","1A,1B,1C,2G,5C"

Inclusion of Atlanta will expand the WIHS research expertise and agenda to include areas for which the Emory faculty are leading experts nationally. The potential of an Emory CRS is evident from the experience and excellent track record in the accrual of hundreds of women into HIV research including the DAIDS supported networks (ACTG, HPTN, HVTN) trials, and from the availability of state-of-the-art research capacity relevant to women's health (colposcopy, DXA and fMRI, carotid intima ultrasound, cardiac CT, local specimen repository, etc.). The size of our HIV clinical activities, which include 7,921 patients (22% women), 950 whom are newly diagnosed and antiretroviral treatment naive, offers a unique opportunity to diversify the WIHS cohort. Through long-standing collaboration between Emory investigators, county health departments, and community based organizations in the state, the Emory WIHS CRS will attract eligible subjects from rural Georgia and from the hard-to-reach communities to better characterize the changing demographics of the epidemic in the South. Innovative approaches guided by principles aligned with community-based participatory research will be employed to recruit, link, and retain women in the WIHS cohort. The overarching focus of the Emory WIHS application is  HIV/AIDS secondary prevention for women through immunological, clinical, pharmacological, epidemiological and behavioral research.

As such, the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) cohort is expanding to include a new site in the Southeast to make the cohort more representative. Alabama and Mississippi are located in the heart of the Deep South and have some of the highest rates of new HIV cases annually, especially among minority women. Barriers to access to care are among the worst in the US, and the prevalence of obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and health care disparities most pronounced. Therefore, establishing a new WIHS site in this area of the country will provide the opportunity to assess the 'new' epidemic of AIDS as it is emerging today. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) has a rich tradition of AIDS research, dating back to the mid-1980s. As the epidemic has matured, UAB scientists have established expertise in the socio-behavioral factors that propagate the epidemic, including barriers to testing, linkage to care, retention in care, and stigma. UAB scientists have emerged as leaders in innovative cohort research that evaluate the long term outcomes and comparative effectiveness of regimens via multisite cohort studies (e.g., CNICS, NA-ACCORD, ART-CC, and FRAM). By creating a linkage to the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) as a subunit partner, we take full advantage of their years of expertise in HIV clinical care, outreach, and cohort research. Collectively, we represent an ideal addition for WIHS both in terms of scientific expertise and representation of the current HIV epidemic in the US. The Specific Aims for our new WIHS site are: 1. To assess psychosocial barriers to HIV prevention behaviors, testing, linkage to care, and retention in care among recently diagnosed women in the Deep South. 2. To evaluate the influence of hormonal contraception and body fat mass on immune hyperactivation and accelerated immunosenescence in HIV-1 infected women. 3. To determine the interplay between co-existing HPV subspecies and the vaginal microbiome in creating conditions favorable to the expression of cervical dysplasia and malignancy 4. To explore changes in the gut microbiome ('dysbiosis') occurring as a consequence of chronic HIV infection and its treatment. 5. To elucidate nutritional, host genetic, metabolic, and cultural factors that are contributing to the rapid emergence of obesity as a highly prevalent condition among HIV infected women 6. To recruit and retain a cohort of 300 women, half of whom are HIV seropositive and half well-matched HIV-negative controls, who are strategically selected to enable the conduct of the research projects proposed above while simultaneously meeting the needs of the WIHS cohort.","1A,1B,1C,2C,2G,3B,5B,5C"

The early cohort of infected women is aging, and the effects of age and menopausal status on disease outcomes and co-morbidities is yet to be elucidated. The WMW has joined with centers around the country and with sites across metropolitan Washington, DC to address these issues. This is particularly pertinent as Washington, DC has the highest prevalence of HIV of any urban center in the U.S. and the WMW has enrolled and retained a cohort that represents women both ethnically and psychosocially. The WMW has successfully participated in all elements of the WIHS protocol and has actively supported the infrastructure of the national WIHS. WMW investigators have participated in all of the major WIHS scientific initiatives. Additionally, with its rich data baseand local and national specimen repository, the WMW has supported local and national initiatives designed to understand the pathophysiology underlying co-morbidities. The WMW proposes to continue this work and to expand its research portfolio by continuing its strong collaborative relationship with the national WIHS in the area of protocol development, implementation, sub study participation, and identification of new initiatives. Additionally, for the next cycle of funing we have proposed new initiatives that include a telephone-based intervention for depression that will positively impact adherence and health behaviors with the goal of reducing community viral load. This intervention can easily be implemented in the larger DC community. We are expanding our local initiatives on HIV and HCV associated liver disease by engaging a team of researchers in exploring the host response, epigenetic factors, and protein glycosylation in liver disease and cancer. We will also continue and expand our investigations in organ specific morbidities associated with long-term survival in an aging population with the goal of reducing or preventing morbidity in the areas of vascular health, neurocognitive decline, and the vaginal immunologic response in aging. We will accomplish this by engaging with national and local investigators with proven expertise in these areas to further leverage the NIH investment in this important cohort of women. This will allow us to better define the status of women with HIV and bring to fruition the goals of an AIDS free generation and effective and sustainable treatment for those already infected.","1A,1B,1C,2D,2E,2G,3B,5B,5C"

Given our exemplary track record to date, in conjunction with an innovative fusion of new and seasoned investigators, and an invigorated statistical core, we look forward to a continued productive relationship with our colleagues in WIHS.","1A,1B,1C,2C,2G,5C"
2013,8432758,"1 U01 AI103397-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A growing proportion of U.S. women with HIV infection are from the Southeastern United States. Compared to all other states in the Southern region of the U.S., Florida has the highest number of HIV-infected individuals and the highest rates of HIV transmission. Miami-Dade County has one of the highest rates of new infections among women and the prevalence of HIV among women was among the highest in a national study of 21 epicenter cities in the U.S. Heterosexual transmission and intravenous drug use were the major risk factors for infection. Compounding these issues, Miami-Dade County ranks high among U.S. areas in measures of social and economic distress.           The Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) seeks to expand its efforts to better understand the current epidemiology of HIV infection in women with the identification of new sites from the Southern region of the U.S. The Miami WIHS is well positioned to engage women with HIV infection and at risk for HIV infection that are representative of this region and the changing demographics of the HIV epidemic, as well as addressing important current treatment outcomes and the impact of disassociation from care among hard-to-reach populations (e.g. substance abusing individuals). Miami sits at the portal to the Caribbean and Central and South America and, as a result of the high rates of immigration from these regions; the women infected with HIV belong to a wide, diverse population. In addition, the HIV-infected population of women in Miami spans generational boundaries from pediatrics through to the elder.           This project is a multiple PI project between the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health with collaboration from the University of Florida. We will seek to enroll a diverse cohort of 300 youth, young adult and adult women, including women who are at-risk for HIV, those with limited disease progression, those with newly recognized infection, who are antiretroviral treatment na¿ve and antiretroviral treatment experienced participants, and who are in care, intermittently in care and not in care. A highly experienced and diverse team of researchers has been assembled to ensure the success of this program, including clinical, basic and behavioral/social scientists, with strong ties to th community. The specific aims outlined respond directly to the overall WIHS scientific goals and advance and expand the WIHS basic, clinical and epidemiologic/behavioral/social science research agenda. The proposed scientific agenda taps into the experience and expertise of the Miami WIHS researchers to examine critically important and scientifically rigorous research questions. The proposed research projects will examine the impact of aging on immune functionality; reproductive decision making among young adult and adult women living with HIV/AIDS; increasing viral diversity and the impact of HIV-1 non-B subtype infections on the clinical course of HIV and response to therapy; and the interplay of crack cocaine use and associated co-occurring epidemics (mental health, poverty, unemployment and interpersonal violence with uptake of optimal antiretroviral therapy and engagement and retention in care.           By coupling the diverse population base of HIV-infected and at risk women with the recognized strengths in HIV/AIDS research, the Miami WIHS is perfectly situated to advance the overall WIHS scientific agenda of defining clinical outcomes among women across their lifespan, including the uptake of antiretroviral therapy; use and retention of HIV primary care and other ancillary services; treatment outcomes on viral suppression, immune recovery and normalization of the effects of HIV, and disease pathogenesis, as well as, promoting and advancing local scientific research goals.","1A,1B,1C,2C,3B,5B,5C"

The UCD-MMRRC, alongside 2 centers at the University of Missouri-Columbia and University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, and an Informatics, Coordination, and Service Center (ICSC) at The Jackson Laboratory, serves as the distribution archives and data center for the MMRRC National Program. Since its inception 10 years ago, the UCD- MMRRC has been one of the primary mutant mouse archive and distribution repositories in the world. We are the largest archive of three centers, with an inventory of over 28,500 mutant mouse lines representing ~98% of all live colonies, germplasm, and/or embryonic stem (ES) cells in the system. The UCD-MMRRC has fulfilled nearly 6000 orders from more than 2000 investigators at 500 institutions in 30 countries. We have also been a leader in innovation and resource development for the system, introducing new products (e.g., gene trap ES cells) and initiating new services (e.g., blastocyst injection, ICSI) that have added scientific value to mouse models and enhanced utilization of the MMRRC by researchers. UCD-MMRRC has leveraged its infrastructure and expertise to extend its service role by contracting with NIH institutes, biotechnology companies, and several organizations to archive, distribute, custom breed, genotype, and phenotype 1000's of additional ES cell mutants, BAC-transgenic, CRE, ENU-induced, and other mutant mouse collections. In addition, we have worked with the Centers and NIH program staff and developed and implemented advertising and marketing strategies, database management and informatics applications, website and online resources, customer and user services, operating procedures and policies, and shared governance of the national program.","7B"

2013,8432825,"5 R01 MH087714-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sexual Compulsivity (SC) is characterized by sexual fantasies and behaviors that increase in frequency and intensity so as to interfere with personal, interpersonal, or vocational pursuits. Researchers have consistently identified strong links between SC and risky sexual behavior in a variety of populations, but particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM). Sexual behavior is not the only defining feature of SC; sexually compulsive men report a series of psychological symptoms (drug and alcohol abuse, mental health and affective comorbid disorders) associated with their sexual behavior. Research suggests that these psychological factors may exacerbate HIV risk for SC MSM. However, past research on SC MSM has not distinguished between the role of behavioral versus psychological factors in HIV risk among SC MSM. Most studies compare SC MSM with other MSM without controlling for general rates of sexual behavior. Our research suggests that there are significant numbers of MSM who are behaviorally similar to SC MSM (i.e. they have equivalent numbers of sexual partners and engage in sexual behaviors with equivalent frequency), but are psychologically very different from SC MSM (i.e. they do not report distress about their sexual behavior, loss of control, that their sexual behavior interferes with their personal and professional lives, or that they engage in sexual activity under the influence of drugs and alcohol as frequently). These men - highly sexually active, but non-SC MSM - will provide a critical window into the mechanisms by which SC is associated with greater HIV risk and sex under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Identifying factors that distinguish highly sexually active SC-MSM from highly sexually active non-SC MSM will allow us to identify psychological factors that make SC men more vulnerable to high-risk sexual behavior and inform the development of HIV prevention interventions for both populations Addressing these limitations and consistent with PA-07-409  Health Research with Diverse Populations,  this study will compare two samples of highly sexually active MSM, one cohort which exhibits SC symptoms and one which does not. By comparing highly sexually active SC and non-SC MSM, we can better understand both the connections between SC and HIV transmission, and the psychological, environmental, substance use, and contextual factors that make certain men vulnerable to SC and its negative consequences. We will use respondent-driven sampling to recruit 400 (n=200 SC, n=200 non-SC) highly sexually active MSM (> 9 partners, < 90 days) Participants will be followed longitudinally for 13 months and take part in a variety of assessments, capturing both antecedent conditions (neurocognitive deficits, and experienced stigma and abuse) and event-level triggers (drug and alcohol use, and affect). This study will determine the role of these factors in mediating and moderating the relationship between SC and HIV risk behavior. Our longitudinal approach will allow tracking of trajectories across groups and analysis of behaviors within individuals. Ultimately, this study will serve as the foundation for formative intervention development to reduce HIV associated risks among highly-sexually-active MSM.","5B"
2013,8432831,"5 R01 MH085259-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The predominant HIV-1 subtype found in US and Western World is clade B, which differs significantly from clade C that exists in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Estimates suggest that out of about 33.2 million people infected with HIV-1, about 60% of the infection is with clade C alone and HIV-1C infection is rapidly spreading to other parts of the world. AIDS is often accompanied by neuropathological abnormalities. Current understandings of HIV-1 neuropathogenesis emanate from B clade from U.S and Western countries and very little information is available on neuropathogenesis of C clade. We hypothesize that clade B and C exert differential effects on CNS cells leading to differential neuropathogenesis and the mechanisms may be mediated by dysregulation of mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases signal transduction pathways. Accordingly we will study for the first time :(Aim #1a) the effects of in vitro infection with clade B and C virus on production and gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF1 & IL-6), chemokines (MCP-1 & RANTES), and neurotoxin (IDO) by primary monocytes and CNS cells (astrocytes, microglial cells) and examine (Aim #1b), whether the mechanism of differential dysregulation induced by clade specific virus infection is mediated by modulation of mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases signal transduction pathways. Further these in vitro infection studies will be compared, correlated and complemented with ex vivo studies (Aim #2) using monocytes from HIV-1B infected subjects being studied in Miami and HIV-1C infected subjects being studied at the collaborating institute in India. The results emanating from these studies may a) unravel the differential effect of clade specific infection on neuropathogenesis, b) help to develop therapeutically useful agents which could attenuate or prevent the neuropathogenesis associated with clade specific HIV-1 infection and c) design novel strategies to develop preventive and therapeutic global vaccines that can induce cross-clade antiviral immune response against multiclade or recombinant pandemic HIV-1 infection that is currently facing the world including United States where non B subtypes have been recently reported in migrant populations and among our military personals.","2G"
2013,8432832,"5 R01 MH085554-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):While highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically improved the quality of life for HIV-infected individuals, there has been an increase in the prevalence of HIV-associated neurological diseases. In fact, there is ongoing inflammation in the brains of HAART patients. Chronic HIV infection leads to the expression of a key enzyme in tryptophan metabolism, IDO (Indolamine 2, 3, Di-Oxygenase), which is upregulated during SIV/HIV infection. This enzyme dampens cell-mediated immune responses by diverting tryptophan to kynurenine (Kyn) metabolism. Activation of the normally silent Kyn pathway results in draining of tryptophan reserves. Tryptophan is essential for the production of neuroprotective serotonin, activation of effector T cells, and general protein synthesis throughout the body. The Kyn metabolite quinolinic acid leads to neurodegeneration by promoting NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid) receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. Other kynurenine metabolites, combined with the depletion of tryptophan, inhibit effector T-cell function, thus permitting more HIV replication in both the CNS and periphery. The net effect is more virus replication, greater CNS inflammation and upregulation of IFN3, which in turn further upregulates IDO, setting up a positive feedback loop that eventually leads to neuronal damage manifested as motor and cognitive dysfunction. In this application we will investigate the hypothesis that IDO is a central mechanism for the development of HIV-associated neurological disease, determine the extent and timing of IDO expression in brain and the periphery of SIV-infected animals, quantitate inducers of IDO expression (IFN3 and virus), identify IDO expressing cells in the CNS and periphery and define the consequences of IDO expression by quantitating tryptophan, kynurenine, kynurenine metabolites, inflammatory and neurodegeneration markers and viral load. We next will dissect the specific effects of IDO activation and inhibition on individual cell types from the brain and periphery in vitro. Finally we will investigate the consequences of IDO expression and inhibition in SIV-infected animals on serotonin levels in the brain and on effector T cell function in a prospective study.","5B"
2013,8432836,"5 R01 MH087118-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to determine the effect of an innovative, multi-level HIV prevention intervention that will jointly address both structural and social factors that contribute to young women's increased vulnerability to HIV. We propose providing cash transfers to the families of young women conditional on the young women attending school with the goal of reducing the young women's HIV risk by keeping her in school by improving her family's economic resources (structural factors). The structural level intervention will be complemented by a community level mobilization intervention focused on engaging young men around the issues of gender norms and HIV risk and encouraging them to take action to protect young women and reduce HIV risk in their communities. This study will be situated in the Agincourt sub-district of Bushbuckridge of rural Mpumalanga Province in South Africa. Approximately 84,000 individuals live in Agincourt in 25 villages, and the area is a Households Demographic Surveillance Site (Agincourt HDSS). We will use the AHDSS as the platform from which we will identify eligible households and young women for the cash transfer intervention (Aim 1). Young women will be recruited at the end of grade 9 and randomly allocated to the intervention (n=200/arm), a cash transfer to the household conditional on school attendance. The cash transfer will be provided for 3 years (until the expected completion of high school, grade 12). To examine the effect of the conditional cash transfers, young women will be interviewed at baseline and then every 12 months until the end of the intervention (3 years post baseline). After households are identified for the cash transfer intervention, villages will be randomized to receive the community mobilization intervention (Aim 2). We will select community mobilizers (n=15) who will conduct mobilization activities in the intervention villages (n=12), including one-on-one contact, workshops and community events to promote awareness around the role of negative gender norms and HIV risk and to encourage young men and community members to take action to reduce young women's HIV risk. To assess the effect of the community mobilization intervention on changes in gender norms and sexual behavior, we will select a sample of young people (age 18-35) from the 25 villages in whom we will conduct a survey at baseline and 3 years post baseline. We will also assess the combined effect of the cash transfer intervention and community mobilization intervention in young women (Aim 3).","5A"
2013,8432842,"5 R01 MH085597-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has resulted in significantly improved survival of AIDS patients and decreased incidence of HIV-associated dementia. But the activity of ART within the central nervous system (CNS) is still suboptimal. To address these shortcomings, we will develop drug-coated nanocrystals with the goal of delivering superior therapeutics for HIV treatment. We will demonstrate that a nanocrystal (i.e. 2 nm - 10 nm diameter inorganic crystal) can serve as a base scaffold to allow us to overcome several of the limitations of current ART. The size of the nanocrystal will allow both the ability to efficiently disrupt protein/protein interactions, and can be fabricated with a combination of molecules of an array of properties on the nanocrystal surface. We will place targeting molecules such as glucose derivatives onto the surface of the gold nanocrystal to deliver potent antivirals such as integrase inhibitors across the blood-brain barrier and into the CNS. Specific Aim 1: A multifuctional hybrid nanocrystal with antiviral and targeting functions can be designed and synthesized. Specific Aim 2: Drug-nanocrystal conjugates can be optimized for the density of drug molecules on the nanocrystal surface, crystal diameter, and conjugate stability. Specific Aim 3: Nanocrystals will cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and inhibit HIV replication. We hypothesize that nanocrystal-based therapeutics will serve as an adjunct to current ART in selected clinical situations where improved delivery of therapeutic molecules to specific tissues or anatomical or cellular compartments is required. The history of the use of gold salts in rheumatoid disease suggests that long-term toxicities, if encountered, may be manageable. As proof of concept, we will develop and test nanocrystal systems to deliver ART across the blood-brain barrier, to meet this important medical need.","6G"
2013,8432850,"5 R01 AI078783-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The persistence of HIV-1 infection is the result of many factors, including rapid viral evolution to evade immunity, the establishment of reservoirs of both latent and cryptically replicating virus, and damage to the immune system caused directly or indirectly by virus replication. Our understanding of each of these factors remains inadequate to fully explain HIV-1 persistence and pathogenesis. The studies proposed will describe a previously unknown pathway of HIV-1 replication we have discovered that likely contributes to HIV-1 adaptation, to the establishment of viral reservoirs, and to pathogenesis. As a retrovirus, integration of HIV-1 DNA into the cellular chromosome is necessary for productive infection. Interestingly, 90-99% of HIV-1 DNA in vivo and in vitro remains unintegrated and by itself is unable to generate sufficient RNA and proteins to make new virions. However, our published studies reveal that in a productively infected cell, uDNA is complemented by the integrated provirus and completes its replication cycle. In other words, uDNA contributes to the replicating virus population and magnifies the amount of multiple infection. The result is an increased effective virus population size, abundant interactions among potentially divergent viruses, and enhanced virus evolution through recombination and mutation. This novel mechanism for HIV-1 replication is distinct from pre-integration latency and does not depend on subsequent integration by the uDNA. New preliminary data indicate the HIV-1 can superinfect cells and bypass integration, resulting in accelerated viral replication, an important parameter of viral fitness. We hypothesize that uDNA exerts a strong influence on viral evolution, persistence and pathogenesis. Owing to the high stability of circular forms of uDNA in non-proliferating cells, we hypothesize that uDNA constitutes a long-lived reservoir of virus whose replication is restored by productive reinfection of the host cell. Through a combination of experimental and analytical approaches, the following specific aims will test these hypotheses. Aim 1. What is the contribution of uDNA to the replicating virus population? Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that uDNA can function as a reservoir of latent viruses in T cells and macrophages. Aim 3. Examine the influence of uDNA on HIV-1 replication kinetics. Aim 4. Develop descriptive and predictive mathematical models of uDNA's contribution to HIV-1 replication and diversification to explore our main hypothesis.","2B"
2013,8432868,"5 R01 DA015842-08","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature discontinuation from methadone treatment programs (MTP) is a frequent occurrence and is associated with continued illicit drug use, HIV infection, overdose death, and crime. This resubmission of our competing renewal application builds on the findings of our parent grant (5R01DA 015842) in which nearly half of over 350 newly admitted MTP were no longer in treatment at 12-month follow-up, in large part because of the powerful influence of program rules and the role of the counselor as enforcer of the rules. Our goal is to test the impact of a fundamental re-engineering of MTPs, based on the conceptual model of patient-centered care (IOM, 2006),1 in order to avoid premature drop-out and to improve patient outcomes. Nearly all premature discharges in our parent R01 were due to: (1)  administrative  discharge, typically involuntary; (2) patient drop-out; or, (3) not being re-admitted after brief incarcerations. To reduce  administrative  discharge, PC-MTP will reorganize the staff roles and MTP rules. Counselors will not be responsible for enforcing the clinics' rules for their patients, patients will be encouraged but not required to participate in counseling, and most clinic rule infractions will result in consequences short of  administrative  discharge. Administrative discharge, found nowhere else in medicine although common among MTPs, is incongruent with the conceptualization of opioid addiction as a chronic disease. Relieving the counselor of the role of enforcer and making counseling voluntary should alleviate the inherent conflict and power imbalance thereby increasing the therapeutic alliance and patient satisfaction and hence treatment retention. Finally, patients will be actively welcomed by the MTP to return to treatment upon release without arbitrary deadlines to return and their counselors will conduct active outreach for participants not returning on their own. This two-site randomized clinical trial with 300 participants will compare, on an intent-to-treat basis, the relative efficacy of PC-MTP to treatment-as-usual MTP (TAU). Participants will be assessed at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months post-baseline. The study's aims are: (1) to compare the impact of PC-MTP to TAU on: a) days in treatment; b) heroin and cocaine use; c) HIV risk behavior; d) criminal behavior and arrest; e) quality of life; and f) likelihood of meeting DSM-IV criteria for heroin and cocaine dependence at 12 month follow-up; (2) on therapeutic alliance and patient satisfaction; and (3) cost, cost-effectiveness, and cost-benefit. This study promises to examine the re-engineering of an MTP structure that has largely remained unchanged for the past 40 years. Further, since some drug use is not tantamount to dependence, we are including measures of quality of life and DSM-IV drug dependence and hence, our findings may challenge the long held gold standard that considers complete abstinence as the most important measure of patient progress. Because of the poor prognosis of premature discharge in MTPs, increasing retention in treatment can have a powerful effect on overall patient outcome, public health and on cost-benefit of treatment.","5A"

The topic of these dissemination conferences, which will now be called the Summer Institutes on Innovative Methods, is latest advances in methodology for prevention science. The long-term objective of these conferences is to ensure that drug abuse and HIV prevention research maintains the highest, state-of-the-art methodological standards. The proposed conferences will continue to have a highly positive effect on the field of prevention in several ways. First, they will help prevention researchers gain conceptual and practical understanding of state-of-the-art methodological and statistical procedures so that they can use these procedures in their research. Second, the conferences will promote career-long learning in prevention methodology among drug abuse and HIV prevention scientists. Third, by facilitating contact among attendees, the conferences will help to establish an informal network of drug abuse and HIV prevention researchers who are interested in methodology. The Methodology Center at Penn State is uniquely qualified to organize this highly specialized training activity and present on innovative methods relevant to research on drug abuse and HIV prevention. Most of the research to be disseminated at these conferences will originate from the NIDA-funded Center for Prevention and Treatment Methodology. Topics to be covered at the Summer Institutes on Innovative Methods include engineering better behavioral interventions, the analysis of intensive longitudinal data, causal inference and causal mediation modeling, and finite mixture modeling including latent class and latent transition analysis. We see this series as an important vehicle for ensuring that the innovative approaches developed by the Methodology Center are adopted broadly in the prevention science field.","1C"
2013,8432874,"5 R01 MH087520-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Youth and young adults in the juvenile justice system have a high prevalence of concurrent psychiatric and substance use disorders and are also at high risk for HIV. However, even when the disorders and risks are recognized, most programs do not address all of these important problems and long-term efficacy for all outcomes simultaneously has yet to be demonstrated for these multi-problem youth. Adverse outcomes for youth include partially treated or relapsing psychiatric disorders, continued substance abuse, unchanged HIV risk, and further legal problems. This project, in collaboration with the Rhode Island Family Court, with whom we have existing collaborations, will address these issues by implementing an Integrated Treatment Program (ITP) that targets mental health/substance abuse disorders and HIV risk. ITP is novel by targeting multiple adolescent problems simultaneously, involving parents to augment change, and its delivery within the Family Court. This study will extend our previous efficacious interventions among youth with psychiatric disorders to court-involved youth. Adolescents and their parents will be enrolled from the Rhode Island Family Court Mental Health Clinic where youth aged 13-17 are referred by judges for comprehensive assessment and referral for treatment. This randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy, among 200 sexually active court-involved youth who need outpatient treatment, of the novel, integrated treatment (ITP, n=100) as compared to enhanced standard care in community outpatient services (ESC, n=100) over an 18-month period (6 months of ITP or ESC and 12 months of follow-up). ITP consists of three components: 1) individual cognitive behavioral therapy which includes a motivational interviewing component and is modular-based to address concurrent mental health and substance abuse issues; 2) family and parent training sessions to address parental communication and monitoring to support risk reduction among youth; 3) multifamily group workshops to address HIV risk, family communication and peer resistance skills. Youth in both conditions (ITP and ESC) will receive similar case management services from the court and psychiatric medication management (if needed) from a study psychiatrist. ITP will be compared to ESC on reductions in sexual risk behavior, substance use, symptoms of psychiatric disorders, and legal offenses.","5A"
2013,8432877,"5 R01 DA024553-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Opioid addiction has remained widespread throughout the United States since the 1960s and a large proportion of users are involved in crimes to support their habits. After release from incarceration, relapse to opioid addiction is very common and this leads to more crimes and re- incarceration. Treatment advances in the area of medications have not reached this population. Effective medications such as methadone and buprenorphine are not well accepted by prosecutors and judges. Permission to conduct research on the most effective treatment approaches is very difficult to obtain for patients under legal restraint because informed consent is problematic. Naltrexone, an opiate receptor antagonist, has demonstrated pharmacological efficacy in preventing relapse to opioid addiction and it has been reported to be clinically effective in parolee populations although it is rarely used. Recently a depot formulation with a one month duration has received FDA approval for the treatment of alcoholism. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a monthly injection of naltrexone is practical and useful in the prevention of relapse and when compared to treatment as usual. We will also monitor HIV risk behaviors to determine whether the intervention reduces risk of HIV and hepatitis C infections. This collaborative project will take place in six treatment sites where there is a large population of parolees with a history of opiate addiction. In order to prevent even a subtle form of coercion, referrals from parole officers will not be accepted. After determining that all volunteers are opiate free by urine test and not currently opiate dependent using a naloxone test, they will be randomized to depot naltrexone or Treatment as Usual (TAU). Participants in both groups will be given identical follow up monthly for six months with measures of opiate use by self-report, urine test and hair analysis. An additional random urine test will take place each month between monthly visits. Both groups will be re-evaluated six and 12 months later. The University of Pennsylvania will be the coordinating site and each site will have a randomization goal of 20 new patients per year over 3.5 to 4 years to accrue a total of 360 to 400 participants. Treatment outcome will be measured by urine tests, hair analysis, self-report and continuation in treatment. Both naltrexone and comparison groups will receive equivalent voucher incentives to remain in the program. A benefit-cost analysis will be conducted to compare the costs of the treatment with the quantifiable benefits in terms of reduced crime, re-incarceration and medical services and increased employment.","1C"
2013,8432881,"5 R01 DA025537-05","PROJECT SUMMARY: Recent trends in U.S. urban centers indicate a rise in the number of new HIV infections in the population of young men who have sex with men (YMSM). These trends suggest a high level of vulnerability to HIV seroconversion in YMSM through sexual behavior as they emerge into adulthood. In addition, acts of sexual risk taking in this population often function synergistically with illicit drug use, and mental health burden. Despite some success with HIV prevention in the MSM population during the last 25 years, these recent patterns suggest that a reexamination of our prevention strategies for this population, especially for YMSM of color, is needed. Given the interplay that exists between unprotected sexual behavior, illicit drug use, and mental health burden, all such efforts must consider how these overlapping epidemics (also known as syndemics) fuel each other in a cohort of YMSM as they emerge into adulthood. Thus, we will we will initiate a prospective longitudinal program of research to follow the development of syndemics in a racially/ethnically and economically diverse cohort of urban HIV-negative YMSM in New York City as they transition from adolescence into young adulthood, and apply, test, and further develop a theory of syndemic production to understand the development of both maladaptive and adaptive behavioral outcomes. Specifically we seek to (1) develop and test theoretically informed measurement models of the covariance of illicit drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden among emergent adult HIV-negative YMSM within and across time, (2) assess whether patterns of behavior are continuous, discontinuous, or some combination of both; (3) delineate the risk and protective bases-physical factors (i.e., pubertal onset, HIV status), relational factors (i.e., family history of psychopathology, current romantic relationships, peer support, and characteristics of residential, social, and sex neighborhoods), and psychosocial factors (i.e., sexual identity, internalized homophobia, hypermasculinity, racial identity, racial devaluation, HIV optimism) that predict the development of syndemics, and (4) determine the extent to which the development of syndemics varies by race/ethnicity, social class, and homelessness/housing stability in a cohort of HIV-negative YMSM. Using multiple measurement modalities, which include biological assays, calendar based methods, and self-reports, we will follow the development of 675, 18-year-old HIV-negative YMSM. Participants will be recruited through venue-based and respondent driven sampling, as they emerge into adulthood, over seven waves of data collection within a 36-month time frame. We will utilize Structural Equation and Latent Growth Curve Analysis to answer our four main research questions.","1A"
2013,8432884,"5 R01 DA026066-05","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) approaches are effective in reducing alcohol misuse and its associated risk-taking behaviors and negative consequences, there is little research demonstrating the effectiveness of SBIRT for illicit and/or prescription drug misuse. Misusers of illicit and/or prescription drugs frequently seek medical care in emergency departments (EDs), particularly for reasons related to their misuse. As a result, the ED is well suited as a site to conduct an analysis of the effectiveness of SBIRT for this population. The Brief Intervention for Drug Misuse for the Emergency Department (BIDMED) study is a randomized, controlled, trial that will include adult ED patients at a large, academic, trauma center (Rhode Island Hospital) and a community hospital (The Miriam Hospital) who have a subcritical illness or injury and whose screening indicates illicit and/or prescription drug misuse. BIDMED participants will be randomized to receive screening only (SO) or brief intervention (BI) with appropriate referral to treatment. Participants will complete a battery of blinded baseline assessments using standardized instruments as well as adapted instruments specific to the aims of this study. All participants will undergo blinded follow-up assessments at three, six, and twelve months post-randomization. The primary hypotheses addressed in the BIDMED study are that, compared to participants in the SO arm, participants in the BI arm will show a significantly greater reduction in: (1) drug misuse within the prior 30 days at three months post-randomization, (2) behaviors associated with drug misuse at six months post-randomization; and (3) negative physical health, psychosocial health, and socioeconomic consequences at twelve months post-randomization. As a secondary aim, the impact of BI compared to SO will be assessed on participants contacting, enrolling in, and completing a drug treatment program. In addition, the impact of BI compared to SO on increasing uptake of HIV and hepatitis B/C screening will be measured. A mechanisms of change model that addresses the expected mediators and moderators of change to explain the effects of SBIRT in this setting will also be developed and tested. Further, the epidemiology of illicit and/or prescription drug misuse will be assessed in a random sample of ED patients.","5A"
2013,8433061,"1 R15 CA173703-01","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infection with a subset of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) is the major risk factor for cervical cancer. The HPV-16 E6 and E7 genes are selectively retained and expressed in most cervical carcinomas, and persistent infection with HPV and immortalization of cervical cells are important early events in cervical carcinogenesis. Although infection with HPV is required for malignant progression, it is not sufficient. Most high-risk HPV infections are recognized and eliminated by the host's immune response; only a small subset progress to invasive cervical cancer. We are interested in two important questions: (1) what is unique about infections that progress and (2) what are the critical cofactors that promote cervical carcinogenesis in HPV-infected cells. Although HPV infections occur throughout the cervix, approximately 90% of cervical cancers occur within a small anatomic region known as the transformation zone. The transformation zone consists of a narrow band of metaplastic squamous epithelium between the stratified squamous epithelium of the ectocervix and the columnar secretory epithelium of the endocervix. Almost all cervical cancers originate within the transformation zone, but it is unclear why HPV-infected cells from this region have such a high probability of progression. We hypothesize that cells from the transformation zone are more susceptible to immortalization by HPV-16 than cells from the surrounding ecto and endocervix. We also predict that HPV-16-immortalized cells derived from transformation zone are most susceptible to proliferation and dysplastic differentiation in response to two cofactors that promote cervical carcinogenesis, chronic inflammation and estrogen. To examine these questions, human epithelial cells will be cultured from the transformation zone, ectocervix, and endocervix. The cultured cells will be compared for susceptibility to immortalization by HPV-16, and potential mechanisms that contribute to differences in immortalization frequency will be examined. HPV-immortalized epithelial cells from each anatomic region will also be assessed for their response to two cofactors that contribute to cervical cancer, estrogen and the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-¿). Because most cervical cancers arise from the transformation zone, it is logical to focus on how these cells interact with HPV. If our experiments are successful, our results may help to identify important signal pathways or biomarkers that are unique to transformation zone cells and that can be targeted for improved screening, prevention or therapy.","2F"
2013,8433213,"4 R01 DA028532-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this application is to evaluate the impacts of methamphetamine and a range of social, structural, and environmental factors on initiation into injection drug use, HIV risk behavior and sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence among street-involved youth. Globally, it is estimated that there are as many as 100 million street-involved youth, and illicit drug use and related harms (e.g., infectious diseases) have consistently been shown to be elevated among this population. Thus, there is an urgent need for data to inform interventions aimed at addressing the health needs of this growing population. In particular, given the challenges preventing harms (e.g., HIV infection) that occur after youth begin drug injecting, data to inform strategies to prevent initiation into injection drug use are urgently needed. We propose to undertake this work in a western Canadian setting where the explosive growth in methamphetamine use has mirrored a steady growth in the use of this drug in the western United States. While these trends are a source of growing concern due to methamphetamine's relationship with rising HIV risk behavior among men who have sex with men and adult IDU, the epidemiology of methamphetamine use and its relationship to sexual and injection-related HIV risk behavior remain poorly defined. Vancouver, Canada, is ideally suited for the proposed study for several reasons. First, the city is presently experiencing an explosive rise in the use of methamphetamine among street-involved youth, and past experience demonstrates that drug market trends in Vancouver are often reflected in other western US cities, and the city is known to be a North American port of entry for several illicit drugs and precursor chemicals which subsequently flow into the US. Thus, this research will provide valuable data to inform US drug trends and interventions. Vancouver is also home to a large and visible street-youth problem and street-based illicit drug market, and the risk environment in which street youth become involved in illicit drugs has not been well described. Herein, we propose to create an open prospective cohort study of 500 street-involved youth aged 14 to 25 who will complete a standardized questionnaire and provide biological specimens on a semi-annual basis. Given the local drug use and risk environment characteristics, as well as the local laboratory capacity, our proposed research plan offers an ideal opportunity to examine the impact of evolving drug use patterns and a range of social, structural, and environmental factors on the rates of initiation into injection drug use, sexual risk behavior and STI incidence. This research also presents a unique opportunity to create a cohort of street-involved non-injecting youth which will enable comparisons with an ongoing study of adult injection drug users. Together, this research will address several questions central to the urgent challenges facing street-involved youth in North America as a result of the growth of methamphetamine use and illicit drug injecting, and will allow for the evaluation of a range of individual and contextual determinants of HIV risk behavior and STI incidence among this population.","1A"
2013,8433228,"4 R01 AI035237-17","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infectious diseases are a major, re-emerging health problem, accounting for 33% of the world mortality (17 million/year). The emergence of new virulent variants, widespread resistance to antibiotics, and increased worldwide travel are but a few factors that have increased the severity of the problem not only in developing countries, but also for people traveling to these regions, and for individuals with reduced immune functions. Mycobacterial infections continue to be a serious health threat, causing tuberculosis in otherwise healthy individuals, and causing disseminated infections in immuno-suppressed patients. The host defense mechanisms against these infections, including the effector functions of macrophages and parameters of protective immunity, need to be better understood. Such host defense mechanisms can manifest themselves as genetic determinants of innate resistance or susceptibility to infections in human populations, and in corresponding animal models. Using a genetic approach in mice, we have detected a major locus on chromosome 7, designated Trl3, which controls susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis in mice. In the first specific aim of this application, we propose to identify the gene and protein that control this differential susceptibility. This will be done by creating and characterizing a series of congenic and subcongenic mouse strains, in which Trl3 has been isolated by selective breeding. The minimal genetic interval will be carefully scrutinized for the presence of positional candidates that will then be systematically tested in transgenic mice in vivo and in macrophages in vitro. The function of the protein product of the gene and its role in macrophage and dendritic cell defenses against tuberculosis will be investigated. Independently, we have uncovered that a mutation in the transcription factor IRF8 causes extreme susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis in mice, and have identified a homozygote loss-of-function IRF8 mutation in a patient suffering from Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease (MSMD). In the second aim of this application we propose to implement genome-wide methods, including transcript profiling with microarrays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and genomic DNA arrays (ChIP on chip) to systematically identify genes regulated by IRF8, and that may code for key defense mechanisms of macrophages against mycobacteria. A series of in vitro and in vivo experiments are also proposed to validate IRF8 regulation of the identified targets, and to evaluate their role in macrophage defenses against mycobacteria. We also propose to assess the role of these targets in human mycobacterial infections, by monitoring their integrity in a cohort of 300 patients suffering from MSMD.","2D"
2013,8433308,"5 R01 AI094409-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a noncytopathic, hepatotropic DNA virus that causes acute and chronic hepatitis and kills a million people each year from cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently approved therapies for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B include two classes of drugs: interferon and a small number of nucleos(t)ide analogues. However, the indication and response to interferon therapy is poor and associated with severe adverse effects and nucleos(t)ide analogues therapy is frequently associated with the emergence of single- and cross-drug-resistant HBV mutants. Thus, developing a new interferon- and/or nucleos(t)ide analogue-independent therapy is the long-term objective of this application. Antisense-mediated degradation of viral RNA represents such a novel class of antiviral therapy and this approach has been successfully pursued by our collaborator Isis Pharmaceuticals and resulted in a commercialized drug (fomivirsen) targeting cytomegalovirus. Using the same principal, our collaborators at Isis Pharmaceuticals have now identified lead candidate antisense molecules that efficiently inhibit HBV replication in cell culture. Studying the HBV life cycle and its inhibition by antiviral drugs has been and still is hampered by the lack of suitable and widely available in vivo HBV replication and infection systems. I have extensive experience using HBV transgenic mice that express and replicate HBV from an integrated viral genome to study viral gene expression, replication, virus production and inhibition of these steps by interferon-mediated antiviral mechanism. Furthermore, together with our collaborators at the Salk Institute, we have recently demonstrated efficient HBV and hepatitis C virus infection in a novel chimeric mouse model repopulated with human hepatocytes that allows us to study all steps of the viral life cycle during long-term infections. The goal of this application is to use these in vivo HBV replication and infection model systems to further evaluate and improve the therapeutic value and characteristics of the lead candidate antisense molecules targeting HBV. In specific aim 1 we will establish the lead candidate's toxicity and pharmacokinetic profile, demonstrate in vivo activity, and identify the most potent candidates. Specific aim 2 is designed to determine the long-term tolerability and efficacy of the lead candidates in suppressing HBV gene expression and replication in the HBV transgenic mice. In specific aim 3 the antiviral efficacy of the leads and the potential for emergence of drug resistance will be tested in the context of a bonefide HBV infection initiated with a monoclonal viral isolate using human hepatocyte repopulated chimeric mice. Finally, in specific aim 4 we will determine the leads antiviral efficacy against infection with patient sera containing isolates of different HBV genotypes and sera from patients that experienced virological breakthrough on antiviral therapy. Together, these studies will be instrumental in introducing antisense based therapy as a novel approach to combat chronic HBV infection.","6D"
2013,8433310,"5 K23 AI094251-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. John Metcalfe, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Metcalfe is establishing himself as an investigator in patient-oriented clinical research on the epidemiology and transmission of multidrug resistant tuberculosis in high-HIV burden, resource-limited settings. This K23 award will provide Dr. Metcalfe with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to improve scientific understanding of the burden and impact of the multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) epidemic within HIV prevalent settings in order to craft effective public health responses; (2) to apply laboratory research techniques for molecular drug susceptibility testing of clinical specimens; (3) to apply novel biostatistical methods to improve prediction of at-risk patients and to evaluate the incremental value of new diagnostic tests; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Metcalfe has assembled a mentoring team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. Philip Hopewell, UCSF Professor of Medicine and world-renowned authority on global TB control; and two co-mentors: Dr. Arthur Reingold, UC Berkeley Professor of Epidemiology, Associate Dean for Research, and internationally recognized infectious disease epidemiologist, and Dr. Laurence Huang, UCSF Professor of Medicine, an expert researcher in HIV-associated pulmonary diseases.       The convergence of the drug-resistant TB and HIV epidemics represents a major threat to global TB control. The lack of rapid drug susceptibility testing has been a major impediment to effective prevention, treatment and epidemiologic research of drug resistant TB. While recently introduced molecular assays dramatically reduce detection times, these techniques are not routinely available in most settings. Patients with MDR TB in low-income settings are typically only identified after multiple failed treatment attempts. Dr. Metcalfe's research will capitalize on an extensive pre-existing research infrastructure in Zimbabwe centered on an NIH Division of AIDS-funded Clinical Trials Unit (5U01AI069436-04) to improve early identification of patients with MDR TB through novel prediction rules applicable to low-income, high-HIV burden settings (Aim 1), determine which patients are most likely to benefit from molecular drug susceptibility testing (Aim 2), and provide pilot data towards the first prospective study of the contribution of microbial factors to drug resistant TB transmission in a high HIV prevalence setting (Aim 3). This research will form the basis for a future R01-level proposal utilizing longitudinal patient- and pathogen-specific data to characterize development of drug resistant TB in real-time.","1B"

2013,8433319,"5 R01 AI097318-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to determine the importance of the cellular protein apolipoprotein E (apoE) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and production in vivo and to define the underlying molecular mechanism of apoE in HCV infection and assembly. HCV chronically infects approximately 170 million people worldwide. HCV infection is the most common indication for liver transplantation in the United States. HCV is also the major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most rapidly increasing cancer with more than 14,000 deaths each year in the U.S. Pegylated interferon-a in combination with ribavirin is the only option for treatment of hepatitis C. However, more than 50% patients infected with HCV genotype 1, the dominant virus accounting for ~70% infections, do not respond to IFN and ribavirin therapy. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop more efficacious anti-HCV drugs. Identification of novel targets is key to discovery of new classes of antiviral drugs. We have demonstrated that apoE is a structural component of HCV and plays important roles in HCV infection and virion assembly. We have also demonstrated that apoE interacts with HCV NS5A and that the apoE-NS5A interaction is important for HCV assembly. More importantly, our preliminary studies found that apoE but not HCV E2 mediates HCV attachment. However, these findings were derived from the studies with a cell culture grown HCV of genotype 2a (JFH1). The significance of apoE in the HCV life cycle in vivo has not been experimentally examined. In specific aim 1, we will determine the importance of apoE in HCV infection and production in vivo. The HCV-neutralizing activity of an apoE-specific monoclonal antibody and the therapeutic efficacy of an apoE-silencing shRNA will be evaluated in a humanized HCV mouse model using clinical HCV isolates of genotype 1. In specific aim 2, we will define the underlying molecular mechanism of apoE in HCV infection. Specific domain and critical residues of apoE important for receptor-binding will be determined by mutagenesis studies. Additionally, we will identify specific cell surface receptor(s) that mediate apoE-binding and HCV attachment. In specific Aim 3, we will illustrate the mechanism of action of apoE in HCV assembly. Specifically, we will determine the molecular basis underlying the apoE-NS5A interaction and identify cellular mechanism and/or pathways responsible for the apoE-mediated HCV assembly. These specific aims will be successfully accomplished using multidisciplinary approaches, including a robust HCV reverse genetics system, site-directed mutagenesis, RNA silencing, cell biological, immunological, and biochemical methodologies. That HCV uses a cellular protein (apoE) for cell attachment is unprecedented and challenges the current dogma that viral envelope proteins mediate virus attachment by binding to cell surface receptors. New knowledge originating from these studies will result in a paradigm change regarding the roles of viral and cellular proteins in virus infection. The studies described in this application will also provide novel targets for anti-HCV drug discovery.","2D"
2013,8433335,"5 R01 AI094604-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal focuses on penile acquisition of pathogenic SIVsmm infection since this transmission route accounts for nearly half of the global HIV-1 pandemic and has been understudied in comparison with other mucosal routes of transmission. Elucidation of the bottleneck to SIV/HIV transmission and the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying successful infection at epithelial and mucosal surfaces of the penis could be instrumental in the design of effective vaccines. Our laboratories have taken significant steps toward addressing these goals by developing and validating an experimental strategy with which to identify, enumerate, and molecularly clone transmitted/founder HIV-1 and SIV genomes that are responsible for productive infection (Keele 2008; Keele 2009; Salazar 2009; Stone 2010; Bar 2010; Li 2010a,b). In this project, we will test the following hypothesis: Genetically-diverse, rhesus macaque-adapted, pathogenic SIVsmm viruses will productively infect Indian rhesus macaques by atraumatic penile inoculation and lead to persistent replication and pathogenicity. Analysis of transmitted/founder viruses in this transmission model will reveal the extent of the mucosal bottleneck and the impact of neutralizing and binding antibodies on blocking infection. A test of this hypothesis will provide mechanistic insights into the biology of penile SIV/HIV acquisition, the high transmissibility of SIV/HIV during the acute infection period, and the relative protective effect of anti-SIV/HIV antibodies in chronic infection on forward transmission. Specific aims are: (i) To productively infect Indian rhesus macaques by atraumatic penile inoculation of genetically-divergent, macaque-adapted, pathogenic SIVsmm viruses from acute infection plasma; (ii) To identify by single genome amplification and to molecularly clone transmitted/founder viruses from these animals; (iii) To determine if plasma from acutely infected animals contains virus that is more infectious and transmissible on a per virion basis than plasma from the same animals in chronic phase infection; (iv) To characterize quantitatively the bottleneck to penile transmission compared with intravenous inoculation; and (v) To determine if chronic phase plasma contains SIV-specific antibodies that prevent penile or intravenous virus acquisition. A key deliverable of this project, in addition to new scientific insights into penile transmission and mechanisms underlying 'acute- to-acute' infection, will be 8 new molecular clones of transmitted/founder viruses resulting from penile acquisition that represent widely divergent SIVsmm genetic lineages for use as potential vaccine challenge stocks and in further studies of SIV transmission biology.","2A"

2013,8433393,"5 R01 DA014845-10","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An estimated 21 percent of the nation's 7.5 million full-time college students have used an illicit drug in the past month. Moreover, our work over the past three years has documented that concurrent nonmedical prescription drug use, other illicit drug use, and heavy drinking can all potentially affect the health, safety and well-being of college students. Unfortunately, most prior research on college students has focused solely on alcohol; the few studies on college student drug use and associated problems have had limited explanatory power or have not covered a wide scope of risk factors and consequences. Questions regarding the persistence of drug problems, (including substance use disorder) and their sequelae after college remain unanswered. This knowledge gap has severely hampered drug prevention efforts and preventive health care services for young adults. In 2003, our investigative team began an unprecedented NIDA- funded initiative to address this gap-and learn more about the natural history and consequences of illicit drug use among college students. Systematic sampling yielded a cohort of 1253 students for a longitudinal prospective study, of which 95 percent are still active in the study after 3 years of follow-up. In-depth annual interviews have yielded a rich dataset containing a wide array risk factors and outcomes. All students, regardless of academic status, are still being studied. This renewal application builds on our previous findings and proposes to continue our follow-up of this valuable cohort to answer new questions about psychosocial and physical health outcomes as they transition to adulthood. Specifically, it aims to: 1) study the persistence of drug use trajectories, including the resolution of drug problems and development of dependence; 2) understand how college drug use might interfere with achieving developmental milestones such as occupational goals and adaptive social support structures; 3) examine the reciprocal relationships over time of drug use and mental health in relation to physical health (including high-risk sexual behaviors) and quality of life; and, 4) examine potential adverse long-term consequences of cocaine and nonmedical prescription drug use, which have both significantly increased over time in our sample. This renewal offers the field a rare opportunity to probe into new transdisciplinary areas of research, and will use prospective multidimensional modeling that will take advantage of ten years of data to understand their health and functioning in the post-college period. The continuation of this study will maximize the return on NIDA's earlier investment in the project. Ultimately, the results will lead to innovative drug abuse intervention strategies, shape clinical decision-making, and improve health service delivery systems for young adults. Our ambitious and comprehensive approach ensures that this longitudinal prospective study will answer major questions about how to reduce the long-term personal and family turmoil associated with drug abuse, enable young adults to fulfill their individual potential, and reduce unnecessary economic costs to society.","5B"

Our recent survey of U.S and Mexican clients seeking FSWs in Tijuana revealed a startling HIV prevalence rate of 4.1%. Based on qualitative and quantitative interviews with clients from Tijuana Mexico and the U.S. we developed a theory-based intervention (Hombre Seguro) that uses Motivational Interviewing, active participation, and problem solving to increase clients' use of condoms with FSWs. We now propose an RCT to test the efficacy of this one- hour intervention in Tijuana which will enroll 400 HIV-negative men (200 residents of San Diego County; 200 Tijuana residents) who report having unprotected sex with FSWs in the past 4 months. Our theory-based participatory intervention will be evaluated in comparison with a time and information equivalent didactic control condition. Participants will be recruited in Tijuana where they will undergo a baseline CAPI-administered interview, STI testing (HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, Chlamydia), and intervention counseling with follow-up interviews at 4, 8, and 12 months post-baseline conducted in either Tijuana or San Diego. Our study aims are to: 1) evaluate the efficacy of Hombre Seguro to increase condom use of clients with FSWs; 2) determine if the intervention is as efficacious among U.S. versus Mexican clients; 3) determine the extent to which theoretically-based components of our intervention (e.g., self-efficacy) represent underlying mechanisms of change in primary outcomes (e.g., lower HIV/STI incidence); and 4) explore subgroup differences in efficacy of the intervention based on background characteristics (e.g., age), contextual factors (e.g., substance use before/during sex), psychosexual factors (e.g., social-sexual effectiveness), and psychosocial factors (e.g., social network influence). Our primary analytic approach will utilize a generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) approach to repeated measures analysis. This bi-national study will contribute significantly to HIV prevention research by addressing the role of male clients in the escalating HIV epidemics in Tijuana and San Diego, and could have application to other settings where HIV prevalence is high among FSWs and their clients.","5A"
2013,8433411,"5 R01 DA030053-04","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract 9-THC is the major psychoactive cannabinoid in marijuana. Advanced understanding of its pharmacology and the major cannabinoid receptor subtypes (CB1 and CB2) as well as their localization (CB2predominantly on B lymphocytes and natural killer cells) has resulted in identification of multisystemic biomedical effects. Particularly important is the potential of 9-THC modulation of immune function in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. Our studies indicate that chronic 9-THC treatment attenuates viral load and tissue inflammation in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infected non-human primates, significantly decreasing morbidity and mortality from SIV infection. In addition, 9-THC decreased viral replication in an in vitro assay. While the ability of cannabinoids to suppress inflammation and viral replication has been reported by others and confirmed by our ongoing studies, the mechanisms involved are not known. Preliminary data obtained in preparation for this application revealed increased expression of a distinct miRNA profile associated with decreased immune activation and anti-inflammatory properties (based on predicted targets) in CD4+ T lymphocytes, intestinal mucosa, and brain of THC-treated SIV-infected animals. These findings clearly suggest that the overall mechanisms mediating the protective effects of cannabinoids involve novel epigenomic regulatory factors/mechanisms in need of systematic investigation. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that chronic 9-THC treatment decreases pro-inflammatory gene expression and viral replication through epigenomic (non-coding RNAs and DNA methylation) mechanisms. As a result, chronic cannabinoid treatment delays disease progression in SIV-infected non-human primates. This hypothesis will be tested with the following specific aims: 1. Demonstrate that chronic cannabinoid treatment decreases tissue inflammation in SIV-infected rhesus macaques. 2. Identify the epigenomic (including miRNAs and DNA methylation) mechanisms of cannabinoid-induced suppression of inflammation in SIV-infected rhesus macaques. 3. Examine the direct and indirect epigenomic mechanisms by which cannabinoids decrease viral replication. The proposed studies will explore the epigenomic (miRNA and DNA methylation) mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory effects and suppression of viral replication associated with prolonged survival in chronic THC-treated SIV-infected animals.","2B"

2013,8433416,"5 R34 DA031066-03","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With rising rates of opioid addiction, inadequate opioid addiction treatment is increasingly problematic. Buprenorphine treatment can address this problem by reducing opioid use and HIV risk behaviors. Marginalized populations at high risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV, like injection drug users (IDUs), have limited access to buprenorphine treatment. Because of minimal regulations, buprenorphine treatment can be integrated into community-based settings where IDUs congregate. There is great potential for strategies that emphasize community-based buprenorphine treatment to reach marginalized populations, like IDUs.  Building on our previous work in which we developed community-based strategies to improve access to HIV treatment and developed a buprenorphine induction strategy to overcome induction challenges, we believe that developing a buprenorphine treatment intervention in community-based settings is critical to improving accessible and successful opioid addiction treatment for IDUs. Thus, we propose to develop a buprenorphine treatment intervention in non-medical community-based settings to improve access to opioid addiction treatment, improve health outcomes, and reduce high-risk behaviors among IDUs.  We will collaborate with two community-based organizations (CBOs) to develop, test the feasibility of, and preliminarily examine a community-based buprenorphine treatment (CBBT) intervention. We anticipate that the CBBT intervention will consist of: buprenorphine education, facilitated access to physicians, support during buprenorphine induction, and support during buprenorphine maintenance. Additionally, we anticipate that the CBBT intervention will target clients of the CBOs' syringe exchange programs, be implemented by CBOs' outreach workers, and occur in the CBOs' settings. The specific aims are: 1) To develop a community-based buprenorphine treatment intervention. We will conduct focus groups and open-ended individual interviews with two CBOs' staff and clients to guide development of CBBT intervention components, materials, and processes. 2) To test the feasibility of implementing a community-based buprenorphine treatment intervention. We will examine feasibility by: 1) monitoring outreach workers' ability to adhere to the intervention manual; 2) measuring outreach worker and client satisfaction, and 3) tracking clients who engage in the CBBT intervention. 3) To examine treatment outcomes (opioid use, HIV risk behaviors, treatment retention) of a community-based buprenorphine treatment intervention. We will compare change in opioid use and HIV risk behaviors before and 30 days after initiating buprenorphine treatment in clients who received the CBBT intervention with clients who did not. We will also compare 30-day treatment retention.  If CBBT is feasible and can improve treatment outcomes, it could positively impact the opioid and HIV epidemics. Pilot data from this project will guide our R01 grant application, to conduct a large-scale rigorous study of the effectiveness of our CBBT intervention.","5A"
