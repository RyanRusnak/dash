1 F31 DA035709-01,"     DESCRIPTION: The HIV epidemic in the countries of the former Soviet Union continues to be a growing public health problem. Currently, it is the only region in the world where the incidence of  HIV does not appear to be declining. The epidemic is concentrated among injection drug users (IDUs), however there is increasing concern that the epidemic may shift to the non-drug using heterosexual population. Drug treatment in Russia is largely inadequate to meet the needs of the patient population. Treatment for opioid dependency in Russia suffers from a lack of effective therapies because opioid substitution therapy is illegal. Additionally, Russia has one of  the highest incarceration rates in the world. In St. Petersburg, the site of the proposed research,  half of those incarcerated were in prison due to drug offenses, a substantial fraction of those who met the criteria for opioid dependency. Due to weak linkages between incarceration facilities and the community, incarcerated IDUs upon release face a high risk of quickly resuming to opioid use, overdose or death, and engaging in risky injection practices. In this proposal, I will pursue a mixed methods approach to characterize the risk environment facing IDUs upon release from prison. Respondents will be recruited from a much larger parent study (R01DA029888). IDUs who have spent time incarcerated will be invited to participate in this study. For the quantitative component, we will inquire about the amount of time that elapsed from when the respondent was released from prison to when the respondent began using opioids again and whether they experienced an overdose after being released. This retrospective cohort analysis will be limited to respondents who have ever been incarcerated. We will identify factors in the respondents risk environment that may have facilitated relapse or overdose after release from prison. We hypothesize that the majority of respondents who have been incarcerated will have relapse to opioid use within a month of release. Our second analysis will focus on the prevalence and frequency of risky injections among respondents who have a history of incarceration and compare these data to respondents who have never been incarcerated. We hypothesize that IDUs who have been incarcerated will have engaged in more risky injections than IDUs who have never been incarcerated. Lastly, we will recruit respondents who have been incarcerated within two years for in-depth qualitative interviewing pertaining to their risk environment after release. The purpose of the qualitative analysis is to confirm and explain the findings from the quantitative components.          "
1 K02 DA035116-01A1,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this resubmitted K02 application is to further develop Dr. Carrie Oser's productive independent research career and to augment her research focus on HIV, substance abuse treatment, crime, and health disparities by gaining new training on social networks and HIV intervention development. The K02 builds upon her focus on special populations, including both rural drug users and African American drug users. The proposed training goals will provide new instruction in social networks, HIV intervention development, and the responsible conduct of research. The specific aims are: (1) to identify HIV and HCV risk and longitudinal changes in risk in the social networks of 503 rural out-of-treatment drug using women, as compared to men; and (2) to examine the effect of social networks, including structure (e.g., size, density), function (e.g., emotional and instrument support), and content (e.g., attitudes towards physicians), on HIV and HCV risk behaviors and health services utilization among African American drug using women, as compared to men, across criminal justice status. This significant and innovative study will have strong public healt impacts and will support NIDA's Health Disparities Initiative because of its potential to contribut to our understanding of the cultural and social network correlates of health disparities among both rural and African American drug users. In addition, this study improves upon the methodological limitations of previous research findings by examining various social networks (e.g., egocentric, dyadic, and sociocentric) and using longitudinal data in multilevel models. This  proposed project will allow for a practical application of the substantive knowledge and analytical skills acquired from the K02 training activities and will ultimately culminate in the development of forthcoming investigator initiated NIDA grant applications. Specifically, these findings will be used as a foundation for future HIV social networks based intervention to increase special populations' use of preventative health care and subsequently reduce the need for expensive medical services, as well as to decrease HIV risk behaviors including drug use, unprotected sex, and recidivism.

1 K23 AI106406-01,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With 160 million inhabitants, Nigeria is the most populous African nation, and home to the second largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world (3.5 million). In Nigeria and other resource-limited countries (RLS), loss to follow-u (LTFU) poses a major challenge to the successful provision of chronic HIV care. One in four patients are lost-to-follow-up one year after initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), resulting in  loss of over half of the life expectancy gains provided by ART. While some patients are completely lost from HIV care, a lesser-studied group, approximately one in three, briefly interrupt but return to care. Our previous work in South Africa suggests that unplanned care interruptions portend poor patient outcomes. Many studies have characterized patient-level predictors of LTFU, but this knowledge has not enabled service providers to adequately improve patient retention. In addition, few studies have systematically assessed whether health system-level characteristics, which vary widely across treatment programs, predict LTFU and unplanned care interruption. Missing from the assessment of both patient and health system-level predictors of LTFU is an assessment of how these factors inform patient decisions to remain in HIV care, a concept known as ""decisional conflict"". My goal in this proposed K23 award is to utilize a novel framework incorporating health system and patient-level predictors of LTFU and unplanned care interruption, with determinants of patient decisional conflict. This will inform development of a pilot intervention to improve patient retention in HIV care in Nigeria. To accomplish this goal, I will study the AIDS Prevention Initiative Nigeria's (APIN) network in 32 comprehensive HIV treatment centers in 9 of Nigeria's 36 states. I will first investigate health system factors predictive of LTFU and unplanned care interruption by surveying clinic directors on a range of health system services available to their patients, and assessing outcomes of 1,500 patients over one year. I will then establish a cohort of 752 ART-eligible adults to determine the relationship of patient risk factors related to decisional conflict (disease severity stigma, resource deprivation and competing needs) about adhering to chronic HIV care, and the association between decisional conflict and both LTFU and unplanned care interruption one year after ART initiation. Finally, I will build on these findings to develop a pilot intervention n HIV-infected, ART-eligible patients based on a home-based HIV care construct to ameliorate decisional conflict by addressing both health system processes and patient obstacles to HIV care. The research proposed in this K23 award will build on my previous training in epidemiology and biostatistics, allow me to receive further training in quality improvement theory and methodology as well as technical expertise in large program evaluation and intervention design, and will ideally position me to launch my career as an investigator in HIV outcomes and implementation science in RLS.

1 K23 AI108335-01,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines a comprehensive career development plan for the PI consisting of advanced coursework and hands-on laboratory based training in immunology, multidisciplinary mentoring, and practical experience via the completion of the proposed research project. With the K23 Career Development Award, Dr. Kelley will develop the skills necessary to attain her goal of an independently funded HIV translational research career with a focus on biomedical HIV prevention interventions and HIV transmission. Dr. Kelley's ultimate goal is to one day make important contributions to the science of HIV prevention, including optimizing biomedical prevention interventions and vaccine development, for populations at high risk of infection. In order to attain her training goals, Dr. Kelley will b co-mentored during the K23 award period by an immunologist and HIV vaccinologist, Dr. Rama Amara, and an epidemiologist with expertise in HIV prevention for MSM, Dr. Patrick Sullivan. She will emerge from this award period skilled in mucosal immunology, which in combination with her previous extensive experience in clinical HIV medicine, epidemiology, and clinical/translational research, will position Dr. Kelley well to pursue an independently funded research career and one day be a leader in the field of biomedical HIV prevention interventions. Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to have the highest risk for HIV infection in the US, accounting for 63% of new infections in 2010, underscoring the urgent need for effective prevention interventions in this population. Recent advances in biomedical prevention strategies including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), vaccines, and microbicides, have energized the field around further development and implementation of these interventions for key populations at higher risk. However, one potential barrier to the effectiveness of these interventions in MSM is the relative ease of HIV transmission across the rectal mucosa, where approximately 70% of infections occur among MSM, as compared to vaginal or penile transmission. In addition, very little is known about how unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URAI) may modify the rectal mucosa and mucosal HIV target cell populations. We hypothesize that sexually active HIV-negative MSM at risk for HIV infection who engage in URAI will have evidence of (1) reduced mucosal integrity, (2) more mucosal inflammation, and (3) greater HIV target cell availability in the rectal mucosa as compared to men who do not engage in anal intercourse. To test these hypotheses, MSM who engage in URAI and controls will be recruited into a longitudinal study with peripheral blood and rectal mucosal biopsy sampling. First, in a cross-sectional study, we will explore global gene expression differences between MSM and controls in the rectal mucosa with particular attention to gene expression of the epithelial cell junction complex, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and cell proliferation/apoptosis pathways. Next, based on the gene expression analyses, we will choose differentially expressed biomarkers and examine longitudinal differences between MSM and controls in the rectal mucosa epithelial cell layer with quantitative immunohistochemistry. Finally, differences in the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations in the rectal mucosa with respect to expression of the HIV co-receptor, CCR5, memory phenotypes, and activation status will be examined for MSM and controls. Advancing knowledge of how URAI affects the rectal mucosa will provide critical information in two areas. First, it may help to elucidate the differential efficacy of current and future biomedical preventin interventions specifically for MSM populations at high risk. Second, it may suggest other adjunctive therapies to improve efficacy of biomedical prevention interventions. For example, if MSM who engage in URAI exhibit greater inflammation and/or reduced rectal mucosal integrity, an adjunct"
1 R01 AI110369-01,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical male circumcision (MMC) reduces the risk of heterosexual HIV acquisition in African men by 60%. In both our MMC trial in Kenya and the Ugandan MMC trial, circumcised men had lower prevalence and amount of penile anaerobic bacteria, several species of which are associated with Bacterial vaginosis (BV). The benefit is transferred to female sex partners of circumcised men, who had a 40-60% reduced risk of BV. MMC reduced genital ulcer disease (GUD) by 37-52%, and reduced GUD in female sex partners of circumcised men by 32%. Among men in our trial in Kenya, Fusobacteria and Sneathia had 6-fold greater odds of recovery from non-herpetic GUD compared to herpetic GUD. These two BV-related anaerobes are more common among uncircumcised men, and cause oral ulcers and periodontal disease. Their reduction may explain the reduction in non-herpetic GUD in circumcised men and their female sex partners. Cuts, abrasions, scratches, and bleeding of the vaginal or penile skin occur in 30-50% of men and women in our studies in Kenya, and are reduced by 40-60% among circumcised men and their female sex partners. Penile anaerobic bacteria are a common link between MMC and reductions in BV and GUD, and may also explain the reduced genital epithelial trauma among circumcised men and their sex partners. We propose to identify under what conditions the penile microbiome leads to BV, GUD, and genital epithelial trauma in men and their female sex partners. Within a prospective cohort of 204 heterosexual couples, we will measure the penile and vaginal microbiome four times over a one year period using pyrotag sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. We will (Aim 1) determine how the penile microbiome leads to BV, GUD, and genital epithelial trauma, and factors that influence these associations. We will (Aim 2) define factors causing variation in the penile microbiome over time and across men. We will (Aim 3) map specific penile and vaginal bacteria to increased genital inflammatory cytokine levels, and elucidate the link between inflammatory cytokines and genital epithelial trauma. We need to determine how MMC reduces these co-factors for HIV infection to achieve benefits among uncircumcised men and to augment the protective effect of MMC. Pharmacologic interventions to improve penile microbiome health may include systemic or topical antimicrobials, or microbicides incorporating cytokine modulators. We need to identify specific bacteria to determine appropriate classes of antimicrobials, and whether the extent or type of inflammation induced can be modified. If specific behaviors - such as sex during a woman's menstruation or genital hygiene - are associated with types or amounts of harmful penile bacteria, then behavioral interventions will be tested. The potential benefits of interventions stemming from this investigation are: (1) reduced HIV acquisition and transmission through reduction of BV, GUD, and genital epithelial trauma as co-factors for infection, and (2) improved pregnancy outcomes and genitourinary health.

1 R01 DA031581-01A1,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Caribbean region has the second highest prevalence rates of HIV in the world following sub-Saharan Africa and is one of the region's most affected by illicit drug use and drug trafficking. Focusing on men's changing work, migration, and sexual and drug use behavior in the Dominican Republic, the proposed mixed- methods collaborative study examines how HIV risk and drug use among migrant men are related to (1) patterns of migration and (2) the social environments of tourism areas. We relate contemporary demographic changes to HIV and drug use practices through the notion of tourism ecologies - geographically constrained areas in which five ecological features (social isolation; social stigma; business norms; touristic escapism; and drug and alcohol availability) are hypothesized to contribute to high risk behaviors. Our research relies fundamentally on a long-standing multisectoral Community Advisory Board involving private tourism representatives, government, public health officials, and civil society. Data collection consists o: (1) semi- structured interviews with 36 systematically selected male migrant workers in two coastal tourism areas (two interviews per subject = 72 sessions); (2) ethnographic mapping and spatial analysis using Arc-GIS in two tourism areas; (3) a cross-sectional survey with 400 male migrant workers in two research sites; and (4) the implementation of a pilot intervention with 40 migrant male tourism workers. This study contributes to public health knowledge and health promotion in three key ways. First, it identifies the factors in tourism areas that most contribute  to HIV risk and drug use, contributing to the development and piloting of an evidence-based intervention. Second, it draws on an extensive literature to systematically analyze the health effects of tourism environments in high-risk settings for HIV and drug use. Finally, it incorporate a participatory process to research that will strengthen local relevance, research translation, and  the impact on health policies and programs.          "
1 R01 DA034527-01,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is an urgent public need to develop effective pharmacotherapies for methamphetamine (meth) dependence. There are up to 57 million amphetamine users worldwide.1 Use of meth (rapidly metabolized to amphetamine) is up to 20 times more prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM) than in the general U.S. population, and is a major contributor to the HIV epidemic.2-4 Meth use is independently associated with high-risk sexual behavior5-9 and HIV seroconversion.10-12 Effective meth treatments therefore will not only reduce meth use, they could also be important HIV prevention interventions by reducing meth-driven sexual risk.  There are no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for meth dependence, a major gap in the field, because behavioral interventions alone have limited efficacy and would likely benefit from adjunctive pharmacologic treatments.13,14 In a recent double-blind, randomized controlled trial of modest size (n=60) and limited duration (12 weeks), we discovered that compared with placebo, oral mirtazapine, an antidepressant with serotonergic and dopaminergic properties, significantly reduced meth use as determined by reduction in urine positivity in the treatment arm (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.93, p=.02).15 Sexual risk behaviors also declined significantly in the treatment arm compared to placebo. Mirtazapine decreased meth use despite low adherence: by medical event monitoring system (MEMS) caps, only 48.5% of daily doses were taken. All participants received a behavioral platform of weekly substance use counseling and monthly, brief clinician- delivered adherence counseling.  We propose expanding upon these exciting results by determining mirtazapine's efficacy at both 12 and 24 weeks with daily adherence reminders added to the above trial's behavioral platform, and determining if efficacy is sustained up to 12 weeks after drug discontinuation. A sample size of 120 will ensure greater precision of results than the original trial. The primary specific aims of this study are: (1) To determine the efficacy of mirtazapine daily vs. placebo in reducing meth use and HIV sexual risk behaviors among actively- using meth-dependent MSM from 0-12 weeks of treatment. Participants in both arms will receive the behavioral platform of in-person weekly substance use and monthly brief adherence counseling, augmented by daily text messaging adherence reminders. (2) To determine if the efficacy of mirtazapine vs. placebo is sustained from 12-24 weeks on treatment, with both arms receiving the behavioral platform. (3) To determine if the efficacy of mirtazapine vs. placebo is sustained from 24-36 weeks, after discontinuation of medication or placebo and the behavioral platform at 24 weeks.          "
1 R01 DA034538-01A1,"     DESCRIPTION: Cross-sectional studies have identified that court-involved, non-incarcerated (CINI) juveniles exhibit similar substance use and HIV/STI risk behavior rates as those detained or incarcerated. Yet, among first-time offending, CINI juveniles, there is a gap in our knowledge about who might develop drug use problems, engage in HIV/STI risk behaviors, have psychiatric difficulties and/or recidivate and what risk and protective factors may be related to their outcomes. The objective of the proposed research is therefore to investigate 24 month trajectories of drug use, HIV/STI risk behavior, psychiatric symptoms, and recidivism from the point of first juvenile court contact among a cohort of 400 first-time offending, CINI juvenile offenders. Specifically, we seek to characterize the two-year developmental course and co-occurrence of drug use, HIV/STI risk, psychiatric symptoms and recidivism in this population and to identify the individual, family and extrafamilial- level risk and protective factors associaed with these outcomes. First-time offending juveniles, ages 13-17, and a caregiver (N= 40 dyads for Phase I pilot study; N=400 for Phase II survey study) will be recruited from the Rhode Island Family Court, Juvenile Intake Department to participate in computerized survey assessments. In Phase I (first eight months of Year 1), 40 juveniles and a caregiver will be randomly sampled to complete the computerized survey measure once (at baseline, i.e., time of first contact with the juvenile court) to allow for pilot testing of sampling methodology and to provide quantitative and qualitative feedback related to survey development, administration and implementation. In Phase II (last quarter of Year 1 through Year 4), 400 juvenile/caregiver dyads (N=800 total) will be recruited (using a systematic disproportionate stratified sampling approach) at baseline and then re-assessed at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 months subsequent to the juvenile's first court contact. Biological specimens for juvenile drug use and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) will also be collected at each assessment. Baseline and follow-up data will be used to construct individual and latent class growth analyses to characterize longitudinal trajectories of CINI juvenile's drug use, HIV/STI risk behaviors, psychiatric symptoms, and recidivism.

1 R01 DA035146-01,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, an estimated 4.8% of the U.S. population reports past-year nonmedical use of prescription opioids (NMU-POs), an increase of over 40% from 10 years ago. Among young adults 18-25 years old, the prevalence is markedly higher (11.1%). Young NMU-POs are often naive to the serious risks associated with such use, tending to view prescription drugs as relatively safe in comparison to illicit street drugs. Although the majority of NMU-POs begin ingesting POs orally, emerging research demonstrates that a significant minority may transition to heroin use and/or injection drug use (IDU), often within 2-3  years of NMU-PO initiation. This suggests that NMU-PO may function as a new pathway into heroin use and dependence and IDU among youth. IDU and heroin use is associated with significant negative health outcomes, increased sexual risk behavior and increased susceptibility to route-specific infections. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that harm reduction services aimed at preventing HIV among IDUs typically serve older heroin injectors who have been found to differ in age, race/ethnicity and other characteristics from the emerging group of young NMU-POs. The striking increases in NMU-PO throughout the U.S. are thus alarming from a public health perspective, and may lead to increases in HCV and HIV prevalence among groups of NMU-POs. However, research on drug-use trajectories, drug and sexual risk behaviors and, most notably, HIV, HCV and STI prevalence rates, in NMU-PO populations remains scarce. Although very little research to date has examined the sexual risk behaviors of NMU-POs, the body of research on young urban drug users, as well as our team's pilot study of 18-29 year-old NMU-POs, suggests that high levels of sexual risk-taking may be common among NMU-PO young adults. The proposed mixed-methods study will assess the drug and sex-related HIV/HCV/STI risk associated with NMU-PO among young adults. Specifically, we will: characterize the drug-use patterns and sexual behaviors of a representative RDS-recruited sample of 600 NMU-POs (ages 18-29) in the New York City area; determine the proportion of this population that engages in IDU and/or heroin use; and identify individual, network and socio-structural factors that may predispose some NMU-PO young adults to engage in IDU and/or the use of heroin. In addition, key objectives of this research will  be to systematically document the HIV/HCV/Chlamydia and Gonorrhea risk and preventive behaviors, knowledge, testing practices and prevalence rates of NMU-PO young adults. Foundational research that elucidates drug- and sex-related risk behaviors and HIV, HCV and other STI prevalence rates among this growing group of young NMU-POs is necessary for the development of disease prevention messages and interventions tailored to their specific characteristics, needs and drug-use and sexual practices. Furthermore, this research will help identify young NMU-POs who are likely to transition to heroin use and/or IDU, enabling interventions designed to prevent or delay these behaviors to be targeted to groups of youth who are most at-risk.

1 R01 DA035183-01,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies have important methodological limitations that have hindered our ability to develop a useful guideline for effective applications  of alternative measurements for daily patterns of drug use and related risk behaviors in a variety of research and clinical settings. The long-term goal of this project is to extract crucial information from daily process data of health risk behaviors to inform prevention and intervention. The objective in this particular application is to develop cost-effective measurement  and cutting-edge methodology to collect and analyze daily process data. To accomplish this objective, three specific aims will be pursued:1) Develop cutting-edge statistical methodology and free software to address the missing data issue of prospective measurements including the interactive voice response (IVR) system and text-messaging (TM) and to examine reactivity and validity based on daily patterns of health risk behaviors (drug/alcohol use, violence, and HIV risk  behaviors); 2) Conduct an experimental study using a high risk sample with a novel design to evaluate compliance, reactivity and validity under different measurements and assessment schedules; and 3) Analyze the 9 waves of data collected through the proposed project and a prior study to build developmental models for at risk youth in order to inform prevention and intervention. The study design is innovative because the methodology development (Aim 1), experimental study (Aim 2), and statistical modeling (Aim 3) are all built upon prospective data from a high risk sample during the critical developmental period for drug use and related risk behaviors (61% African-American, 100% drug users, 83% involving in multiple HIV risk behaviors). The statistical methodology is innovative because we build a bridge between the statistical science and substance abuse field by introducing and extending new statistical concepts and techniques to evaluate psychometric properties of measurements for daily patterns of drug use and related risk behaviors. The proposed research is significant because this is the first study that compares the IVR, TM and the most commonly used retrospective measurement, the timeline follow back (TLFB), for measuring daily patterns of multiple risk behaviors in terms of compliance, reactivity, and validity. The finding of this study can inform prevention scientists and clinicians about effective applications of alternative measurements to assess risk for long-term health problems, develop screening protocols, design intervention facilitating behavioral changes, and evaluate intervention effects longitudinally.

1 R01 DA037244-01,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The virus population bottleneck to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission in injection drug users (IDUs) remains an understudied and controversial area of research with substantial potential relevance to prevention efforts, including vaccine design and assessment. Single genome sequencing (SGS) represents a powerful strategy for identifying and characterizing viruses that are responsible for establishing productive clinical infection (termed transmitted/founder, or T/F,  viruses). Scientists have only recently begun to apply this approach to HIV and HCV transmission in IDUs; there are just two small studies enumerating HIV-1 T/F viruses in IDU subjects with conflicting conclusions, and a single study of HCV transmission in plasma donors where IDU were technically excluded. Importantly, these HIV-1 and HCV cohorts had neither longitudinal sampling nor comprehensive behavioral data available, which are critical in IDUs to distinguish between sexual and injection-related virus acquisition. In this application, we propose to combine novel quantitative and qualitative analyses of the HIV-1 and HCV T/F viruses responsible for productive clinical infection with a detailed assessment of injection and sexual transmission risk behaviors in a robust and clinically well-defined study population of 52 HIV-1 seroconversions and 71 HCV seroconversions from two recent HIV Prevention Trials Unit studies in Xinjiang, China. This application tests the hypothesis that IDU transmission is governed by quantifiable behavioral risks that determine the rates of virus acquisition, the multiplicity of virus infection, the virus phenotype and clinical outcomes of HIV and HCV infection. We will address this hypothesis by (i) identifying and enumerating the T/F HIV-1 and HCV viruses from the Xinjiang IDUs with acute HIV-1 and HCV infection, (ii) inferring the mode of transmission (sexual vs. injection) and determining the behavioral correlates of HIV-1 and HCV acquisition and multiple virus transmission, (iii) assessing the role of multiplicity of virus infection on HIV and HCV clinical outcomes, and (iv) molecularly cloning and determining the biologic phenotype of T/F HIV-1 Envs and the replication competence of HCV full-length genomes from this cohort of Chinese IDUs. Accurate characterization of the HIV and HCV transmission bottleneck in IDUs and its role in clinical disease progression will provide key information relevant to HIV-1 and HCV transmission, natural history and prevention, and in addition, will provide essential virologic data and molecular reagents for vaccine research focused on HIV-1 and HCV strains relevant to China, Southeast and Central Asia.

1 R01 HD077882-01,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young women in South Africa (SA) are experiencing the highest HIV prevalence (16-30%) and incidence (3 to 5%) rates in the world, with very high male to female HIV transmission rates (2 to 6%). Although sexual behaviors have been the focus of HIV prevention research, it is clear that these high rates cannot be explained by risk behaviors alone. Recent observational studies have identified that hormonal contraception (HC), and in particular injectable contraceptive (ICs) such as DMPA may increase the risk of HIV transmission in women and this risk is significantly higher in younger women (<20 years). Herpes Simplex Virus-2 (HSV-2), has been shown to be associated with a significant increase in HIV infection in women. Given that ICs (DMPA and NET-EN) are the most commonly used contraception among young women in SA, it is critical we have more empirical data to understand the mechanism by which ICs modify the risk of HIV and HSV-2. We propose to conduct a prospective cohort study among 600 sexually active women aged 16 to 24 years based on current use of ICs or non-HCs (condoms, IUD) so as to assess: Aim 1: the impact of IC on incidence of HIV and HSV-2 and point prevalence of HPV and common bacterial STIs. Women will be tested for HIV every 3 months and samples for HSV-2, HPV and bacterial STIs will be collected quarterly, tested annually and all positive samples will be back-tested to ascertain the approximate time of infection. Aim 2: Through the use of computer assisted self-interviews, we will collect sensitive sexual behavior information from all women (N=600) during quarterly visits and assess impact of IC and associated risk behaviors. Aim 3: A subset of women (N=30), will be seen at weekly intervals for one menstrual cycle to assess changes in genital tract micro flora, and mucosal immunity associated with IC use as well as exposure to infections, controlling for changes in endogenous hormones. Discrete Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests will be used to estimate the incidence rates of HIV and HSV-2, stratified by contraceptive use. Cox regression models will be used to identify effects for fixed covariates at baseline (IC versus non-HC), and time-independent (demographics) or time-dependent (contraceptive exposure, changes in genital structure, immune cells, sexual behavior) covariates. Survival analyses will be used to assess the impact of IC on HIV progression (time to death, CD4 decline, etc.). Marginal structural modeling will be used for all recurrent and multiple events to account for the time-dependent confounding in our study. In South Africa, young sexually active women are at high risk for HIV and HSV-2 infection, as well as other common STIs, and a majority use ICs. These data will provide guidance on the safety and efficacy of ICs for women at risk for STIs and HIV, and assist in the development of new multi-purpose reproductive health technologies that combine reproductive health, HIV and STI prevention.

1 R03 DA033899-01A1,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Opioid Use and HIV/HCV Risk among Immigrant Youth from the Former Soviet Union Principal Investigator: Honoria Guarino Informed by social ecological models of the ""risk environment"", this exploratory study uses a mixed-methods approach to gain a multi-faceted, ethnographically-informed understanding of contextual factors shaping drug use, HIV/HCV risk, and utilization of drug treatment and HIV/HCV testing and prevention services among opioid-using young adult immigrants from the former Soviet Union (FSU). FSU immigrants are an increasingly significant group throughout the U.S. (nearly 1 million). Recent empirical and clinical evidence strongly suggests that opioid misuse and injection drug use (IDU) occur at alarmingly high rates among youth within FSU communities in the U.S., yet virtually no systematic research has been conducted on this problem. Moreover, due to a combination of sociocultural, behavioral and epidemiological factors unique to this population - including high-risk drug use environments in their countries of origin and, within their post- immigration communities, high rates of risky injection practices and sex work among young drug users and high background HCV prevalence - opioid-using FSU youth may be at heightened risk for HIV/HCV infection. These sources of vulnerability are compounded by a constellation of cultural factors specific to FSU immigrants, such as discomfort with traditional psychosocial drug treatment models predicated on self- revelation and a fear of community stigmatization, which have been reported to function as barriers to youths' use of drug treatment and disease prevention services. The proposed study will recruit a sample of 80 opioid- using FSU immigrants (ages 18-29) from the NYC area, 40 of whom will be in drug treatment, and 40 of whom will be current opioid users not in drug treatment. To allow us to characterize this understudied group, document their sex- and drug-related risk behaviors and drug use patterns, and explore the potential influence of immigration and acculturation on drug use and disease risk, these 80 youth will complete a series of structured assessments. Using theoretical sampling, a diverse subset of 24 youth will also be asked to participate in in-depth, qualitative interviews. In order to ensure that the research reflects the needs and perspectives of three key groups of FSU community stakeholders, we will also conduct: interviews with 6 experts with specialized knowledge of FSU youth drug use; focus groups with 12 drug treatment providers at facilities with substantial numbers of FSU clients; and interviews with 12 parents of opioid-using FSU youth. The proposed research promises to contribute significantly to public health by providing an evidence base to inform the development of culturally-targeted drug treatment approaches for the at-risk and underserved population of opioid-using FSU youth, as well as a culturally-appropriate HIV/HCV prevention intervention, to be developed in a subsequent proposal, that will be effective, acceptable, and engaging to this vulnerable group. Such empirically-grounded intervention efforts may help prevent localized outbreaks of HIV/HCV from occurring in FSU communities in the U.S. as have occurred in many former Soviet countries.

1 R03 DA035689-01,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite sharp increases in the incidence of HIV among young black men who have sex with men (MSM), most of these men, even low-income substance-using MSM who are at the highest risk for HIV, successfully avoid the virus. This suggests that men may be managing their sexual behaviors and substance use to achieve this, possibly in a systematic way, even though most fail 100% adherence to condoms and total abstinence from drugs. Although there are ample data on factors associated with risk for HIV, few studies have used a ""positive deviance"" approach (that is, a focus on adaptive strategies in high-risk individuals who successfully avoid a disease) to study adaptive strategies that facilitat avoidance of HIV. Objectives: The purpose of the proposed study is to discover a range of strategies for risk avoidance that have not been previously documented or measured, as well as symbiotic goals that might contribute to developing these strategies, and to develop a psychometrically sound scale with which to assess strategies. Our specific objectives are as follows: (1) Identify the range and nature of adaptive strategies used to avoid HIV as well as symbiotic goals that might contribute to maintaining and developing these strategies; (2) Develop items for an adaptive strategies scale; (3) Test the psychometric properties of the adaptive strategies scale. Assessing adaptive strategies and symbiotic goals for avoiding risks associated with HIV can contribute to realistic, effective strengths-based approaches to HIV prevention for young black drug-using MSM. We anticipate that the project will lead to a follow-up study to test the extent to which young black MSM use adaptive strategies and statistically confirm the relationships between engaging in these strategies and remaining HIV negative and to identify predictors of engagement in adaptive practices. Methods: During Phase 1 of our study, we will identify the nature and range of adaptive strategies through qualitative, in-depth semi-structured interviews with 30 young black, low-income, substance-using MSM recruited through convenience sampling. During phase 2, we will develop candidate items for an adaptive strategies scale using the most commonly discussed themes and concepts from the in-depth interviews. We will use theme analysis and pile-sorting techniques to identify common strategies and symbiotic goals. We will pre-test the validity of scale items through cognitive interviews with  5 MSM. Cognitive validation involves finding out what respondents are thinking when they answer the questionnaire items and how this cognition might affect responses. Finally, in Phase 3, we will field test the validity and reliability of the questionnaire among a sample of 100 low-income, substance-using black MSM between 18 and 30 who are HIV-negative. All prospective participants will be offered rapid HIV testing, pre- and post-test counseling, and referral to HIV treatment, and will be compensated $30 for participation.          "
1 R21 AA022065-01,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important and previously largely unaddressed issue in Sub-Saharan Africa, and in Uganda specifically, is the role of alcohol marketing and early alcohol use among youth in their path towards HIV acquisition. Alcohol use in Uganda is of particular concern since the country has one of the highest per capita consumption levels world-wide.  While alcohol research in Africa has been scarce, alcohol use in primarily Sub-Saharan Africa has been found to be associated with unprotected sex and other health concerns. Research also shows that alcohol marketing, specifically through the provision of free alcohol to youth (ages 13-15), is relatively common in Zambia (30%) and that this form of marketing in turn is associated with problem drinking and drunkenness.  However, there is a dearth of information about alcohol marketing practices and their influence specifically on youth in Uganda. Previous research shows that youth who are exposed to alcohol marketing are also more likely to initiate alcohol use early, and in turn, that initiation leads to more problem drinking and drunkenness.  However, these findings based on data available primarily in Zambia, have not yet been empirically examined in Uganda. The current mixed-methods project will develop a structural intervention designed to reduce the extent to which early alcohol use exacerbates risk for HIV transmission among youth ages 12-18 years of age. The project will include conducting an environmental scan of alcohol, conducting formative research (surveys and focus groups) with youth and leaders of community based organizations and the development of communication messages and materials to devise a counter marketing campaign. The project will be guided by an interdisciplinary and international Project Advisory Board comprised of distinguished alcohol researchers, that serve vulnerable and urban youth in Kampala, Uganda. The goals of the project is to better pioneers in the field of alcohol marketing, and valued leaders of community based organizations understand the prevalence and types of alcohol marketing that youth are exposed to and to develop counter marketing messages that will seek to delay and reduce early alcohol use and alcohol-related risky sexual behaviors that increase risk for HIV transmission.

1 R21 DA033888-01A1,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Egypt faces several challenges in maintaining a low HIV/AIDS prevalence, including a general reluctance to address risk practices and issues associated with marginalized groups (such as injection drug users [IDU]), stigmatization of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and changes in sociocultural norms toward sexual behavior, alcohol, and injection drug use. In addition, the lack of effective STI/HIV/AIDS education and other prevention programs among at-risk groups compound the pervasive culturally-based fears and stigmatization of HIV/AIDS and STIs. Egypt also has the highest Hepatitis C (HCV) prevalence in the world estimated at 14.7% (PNAS). Transmission routes that contributed to this may exacerbate HIV/AIDS transmission. One study reported the HCV prevalence among IDUs at 63% (Saleh 1998), indicating that this group is particularly vulnerable to HCV-HIV co-infection (MENA Synthesis Report, UNAIDS 2009). Despite evidence which suggests that there is a growing concentrated HIV epidemic among IDUs, estimated at 6.8% (BBSS 2010) little research has been conducted with this population to assess their knowledge of and health care seeking practices around STI, HCV, and HIV, little research has been conducted to capture the prevalence of STI, HCV, and HIV prevalence and co-infection rates, and there are few interventions to address the current HIV epidemic. Consistent with the goals and mission of the National Institute of Drug Abuse, we propose to conduct qualitative and quantitative research complemented with a STI/HCV/HIV prevalence study to understand the role of injection drug use and HIV/co-infections among IDUs. We propose to build upon the results of qualitative research conducted by the team to quantify high risk behaviors in order to inform the development of a culturally appropriate health education and HIV/AIDS counseling and testing (HCT) interventions targeting IDU populations in Egypt, recognizing that they are an important bridging group to the general population, in order to reduce the public health impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Evidence suggests that throughout the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) there are active high-risk networks where HIV is being transmitted and clustering in multiple risk groups has been documented (Mumtaz 2011). A similar trend was documented in Russia, when IDU represented the main mode of HIV transmission for at least a decade, and was soon replaced by other modes of transmission (Thomson 2009). Egypt is the largest Arab country in the world and has a strong influence on the MENA region. This study has the potential to impact the HIV/AIDS landscape in MENA by providing needed data on high risk behaviors among IDUs and prevalence estimates. More significantly the results of this study will lead us to a larger R34 application to adapt efficacious HCT and STI screening programs in order to develop and pilot culturally appropriate health education and HIV/AIDS counseling and testing (HCT) intervention targeting IDU populations in Egypt.

1 R21 HD074439-01A1,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women account for nearly one-half of new HIV-1 infections worldwide, including the majority of infections in Africa. Heterosexual intercourse is responsible for most HIV-1 transmissions to women, and the majority of HIV-1 infected women are of reproductive age. Biologic and epidemiological studies have suggested that the use of hormonal contraception may influence HIV-1 susceptibility and infectiousness, but the relationship has not been consistent across all studies. Understanding the relationship between hormonal contraceptive use and HIV-1 risk is a topic of public health importance, because effective family planning is central to initiatives to improve the health of women and children worldwide. A central critique of studies of the hormonal contraception-HIV-1 relationship has been that condom use, particularly accurate reporting of use, could differ for contraceptive users versus non-users, a bias that could result in increased HIV-1 risk.  Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), in which HIV-1 uninfected persons use antiretrovirals to protect against sexual HIV-1 acquisition, is a promising new HIV-1 prevention strategy. We recently demonstrated in the Partners PrEP Study, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of PrEP among HIV-1 uninfected partners in 4758 African heterosexual HIV-1 serodiscordant couples, that oral emtricitabine/tenofovir (FTC/TDF) PrEP reduced HIV-1 acquisition risk by 75% (p<0.001). However, not all PrEP trials have shown HIV-1 protection; a number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain divergent PrEP trial results in women, primarily adherence to PrEP but also evidence to suggest possible biologic or behavioral interactions between PrEP and hormonal contraception.  Whether any potential increase in HIV-1 risk due to contraceptive method could be offset by PrEP use is a critical question for the development of ""dual protection"" strategies (i.e., providing protection against HIV-1 and pregnancy), as is whether PrEP and hormonal contraceptives interact in a way that might undermine their HIV- 1 or pregnancy prevention effects.  We are uniquely positioned to analyze data and samples from the Partners PrEP Study to inform key questions exploring the interactions of hormonal contraceptive use, PrEP use, and HIV-1 and pregnancy outcomes. Specifically, we will: 1) assess the effect of hormonal contraception on risk of HIV-1 acquisition in women and transmission from women to their male partners, 2) determine whether a) HIV-1 protection by PrEP is diminished in contraceptive users and b) PrEP reduces the pregnancy- prevention effects of contraception, and 3) among HIV-1 uninfected women, measure bias in sexual behavioral reporting for hormonal contraceptive users vs. non-users, which could explain whether increased HIV-1 risk for hormonal users is primarily a biologic or behavioral effect - an important step for prioritizing research and policy responses. The proposed analyses offer an unprecedented opportunity to examine important global public health questions: what is the spectrum of risk associated with use of different contraceptives, can antiretrovirals be used safety for prevention in conjunction with common hormonal contraceptive methods, and can PrEP offset potential increased HIV-1 risk associated with hormonal contraceptive use? The project team has the expertise to address these timely questions with this dataset. The results of the proposed projects will fill critical knowledge gaps  that are key to the health of women worldwide and are urgently needed by family planning advocates, HIV-1 prevention scientists, clinicians, and policymakers in order to develop clear messages for women using hormonal contraception and to provide the safest contraceptive options to women with and at-risk for HIV-1.

1 R21 MH099942-01A1,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed pilot project is to better understand how geographic information systems (GIS) integrated with SMS cell-phone technology can facilitate improvements in linkage to Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT) and reduce time between diagnosis and consistent treatment with antiretrovirals (ARV) in a rural setting in Tanzania. While promising improvements in PMTCT have occurred, there remains varied access to HIV counseling and testing and subsequent access to antiretroviral treatment for mothers testing positive for HIV. Research is emerging that underscores the potential for mobile phones to improve HIV diagnosis, prevention, and adherence to treatment throughout Sub-Saharan Africa and additional evidence illustrates the utility of using geographic information systems (GIS) in HIV care. Through combining these technologies, the interactive and dynamic system can be used to: facilitate real-time responses to delivery of care, to establish HIV VCT in areas with emergent infections, to increase referrals to the District Hospital, and to inform the distribution of additional medication and treatment for  mothers and infants for facilitation of PMTCT. Guided by the Diffusion of Innovation (DI) Theory, the proposed pilot project will achieve a baseline for a subsequent randomized controlled trial that will test the efficacy of a culturally sensitive, technologically relevant PMTCT program for Misungwi, Tanzania. The pilot will develop and test a mobile phone-based record keeping system that will interface with existing GIS resource maps to facilitate and document delivery of PMTCT and VCT in Misungwi. The system will be implemented in the district over a 3-month period in order to establish how well the system works. The implementation phase will be followed by evaluation of the system with respect to the HIV treatment cascade, including whether an increased number of new HIV infections are identified, if the time is reduced between HIV diagnosis and start of treatment for women of childbearing age, and whether increased adherence to medication among female clients of HW using the mobile phone based tools occurs. We anticipate that this interactive and dynamic system will contribute to best practices in PMTCT by facilitating improved responses to delivery of care in these rural settings, assisting in locating additional HIV PMTCT programs in areas with emergent infections, and informing the distribution of additional medication and treatment for mothers. The explicit design of the study provides a model that could be scaled up in Tanzania and other East African settings. Additionally, if successful, the proposed approach holds great potential for replication to other priority populations for HIV and other health outcomes.          "
1 R24 AI106039-01,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The San Diego Primary Infection Resource Consortium (PIRC) R24 application represents an opportunity to sustain more than 16 years of remarkably productive collaborative research related to the identification and recruitment of persons with acute and early HIV (AEH) infection from the San Diego community. Using novel and evolving methods to recruit persons with AEH, we have established extensive infrastructure and community support to test 3,600 individuals annually using dual point-of-care HIV rapid test (RT) screening, paired with HIV nucleic acid testing (NAT) in all RT negative persons. The projected HIV screening program will ensure the identification and recruitment of 45 AEH, 40 chronic HIV (C-HIV), 40 sexual partners (SP) of participants with AEH (both transmitting and non-transmitting) and 120 repeatedly-exposed, HIV uninfected (EU-HIV) individuals each year. From these participants, vve propose to collect, process, cryostore, and make available a variety of biological specimens (depending on stage of HIV infection), including blood plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), genital secretions, rectal swabs, and oral fluid. We also record extensive demographic, behavioral, and risk data that are linked to participants and their stored specimens. The PIRC proposes to offer access to both archived and prospective resources using a multi- institutional review of concept sheet research proposals submitted by eligible consortium investigators. In order to provide access to richly annotated data and specimens and to enable prospective basic, translational, epidemiologic, and modeling research, the PIRC will address the following Specific Aims: 1) Program oversight and research access to PIRC; 2) Identify, enroll, and retain a cohort representative of the San Diego HlV epidemic and suitable for accurate inference of transmission dynamics; 3) Collect clinical and behavioral information, and biological samples from piRC participants; 4) Provide integrated, flexible and accessible data management and information technology guidance and support; and 5) Provide statistical and network modeling expertise. The PIRC will provide a sophisticated online data storage and retrieval system that will facilitate concept sheet submission and data access for consortium investigators.           RELEVANCE: The San Diego Primary Infection Resource Consortium (PIRC) will provide extensive clinical and behavioral data, biological materials, open source software tools, and services that are of high quality and cost-efficient. The breadth of the collected data will represent a significant opportunity for consortium investigators to evaluate pressing issues related to HIV transmission, prevention, resistance, superinfection, and eradication.

1 R43 HD078154-01,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A policy statement by the World Health Organization notes that, ""the male latex condom is the single, most efficient, available technology to reduce the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections."" Unfortunately, despite decades of condom promotion efforts, condoms usage rates remain disappointingly low. Between one-third and one-half of men report poor condom fit, and these men are more likely to forego condom use. TheyFit LLC seeks to address this by manufacturing 'custom-fitted' condoms, with 95 different sizes available based on user-determined length and circumference measurements. Currently, only a narrow range of condom sizes are available in the United States due to regulatory guidelines governing manufacturing and testing procedures that require burst tests designed for a narrow range of condom sizes. We seek to conduct laboratory condom testing to increase the evidence base for adopting new draft international standards that establish a model of burst test standards allowing a broader range of condom sizes to be tested. Adoption of expanded testing standards is critical to enabling a wider range of condom sizes to be available in the United States. We also seek to improve upon traditional self-report mechanisms of penis measurement by validating the TheyFit measuring tool. This would address an important research question regarding validated measures and supply information on whether users have sufficient proficiency to accurately determine their custom condom size. To provide reference data for a future clinical trial, we will analyze data, previously collected from a national sample of men who have sex with men, to establish condom breakage rates for anal sex. This analysis will provide innovation by allowing further research to move condoms towards being regulated medical devices for anal sex. On both grants, TheyFit will work in collaboration with faculty in Emory University's Department of Epidemiology, who have extensive expertise conducting research regarding HIV/AIDS among sexual minority populations. The proposed research has potential to inform efforts aimed at reducing HIV-related disparities and reducing new HIV infections, meeting two priority areas identified in the Strategic Plan of the NIH Office of AIDS Research.

1 U01 AI103390-01,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to establish The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a new site for the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). The proposal represents a collaborative effort between investigators from The UNC Center for Infectious Diseases, Center for AIDS Research, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research. We propose to rapidly establish the UNC-WIHS cohort, contribute meaningfully to the national WIHS scientific program, and undertake an ambitious HIV research agenda that encompasses social epidemiology and health outcomes, advanced epidemiologic and biostatistical methods, pathogenesis, and molecular biology of cancer. We aim to: 1) Recruit and retain in follow-up a cohort of 200 HIV+ and 100 HIV- women who are at high risk for HIV infection and represent NC's HIV epidemic, thus expanding the WIHS Cohort to women who live in a region at the forefront of the US epidemic; 2) Characterize the relationship between socioeconomic context, changes in access to health insurance, and health outcomes among HIV+ and HIV- women; 3) Develop and apply novel epidemiologic and statistical methods using data from the UNC-WIHS and the entire WIHS cohort; 4) Characterize HIV persistence in the blood and genital tract among pre- and post-menopausal women; and 5) Investigate the pathobiology of breast and cervical cancers to identify immunological, microbial and genetic factors that affect cancer progression and treatment in HIV positive women. By contributing a diverse and complementary population of women, innovative science, and a strong, multidisciplinary cadre of investigators, UNC will enhance the efforts of the WIHS, expand the range of questions that can be addressed and, in collaboration with the entire group, improve the health of HIV+ women and women at high risk for HIV infection.

1 U01 AI103397-01,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A growing proportion of U.S. women with HIV infection are from the Southeastern United States. Compared to all other states in the Southern region of the U.S., Florida has the highest number of HIV-infected individuals and the highest rates of HIV transmission. Miami-Dade County has one of the highest rates of new infections among women and the prevalence of HIV among women was among the highest in a national study of 21 epicenter cities in the U.S. Heterosexual transmission and intravenous drug use were the major risk factors for infection. Compounding these issues, Miami-Dade County ranks high among U.S. areas in measures of social and economic distress.           The Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) seeks to expand its efforts to better understand the current epidemiology of HIV infection in women with the identification of new sites from the Southern region of the U.S. The Miami WIHS is well positioned to engage women with HIV infection and at risk for HIV infection that are representative of this region and the changing demographics of the HIV epidemic, as well as addressing important current treatment outcomes and the impact of disassociation from care among hard-to-reach populations (e.g. substance abusing individuals). Miami sits at the portal to the Caribbean and Central and South America and, as a result of the high rates of immigration from these regions; the women infected with HIV belong to a wide, diverse population. In addition, the HIV-infected population of women in Miami spans generational boundaries from pediatrics through to the elder.           This project is a multiple PI project between the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health with collaboration from the University of Florida. We will seek to enroll a diverse cohort of 300 youth, young adult and adult women, including women who are at-risk for HIV, those with limited disease progression, those with newly recognized infection, who are antiretroviral treatment nave and antiretroviral treatment experienced participants, and who are in care, intermittently in care and not in care. A highly experienced and diverse team of researchers has been assembled to ensure the success of this program, including clinical, basic and behavioral/social scientists, with strong ties to th community. The specific aims outlined respond directly to the overall WIHS scientific goals and advance and expand the WIHS basic, clinical and epidemiologic/behavioral/social science research agenda. The proposed scientific agenda taps into the experience and expertise of the Miami WIHS researchers to examine critically important and scientifically rigorous research questions. The proposed research projects will examine the impact of aging on immune functionality; reproductive decision making among young adult and adult women living with HIV/AIDS; increasing viral diversity and the impact of HIV-1 non-B subtype infections on the clinical course of HIV and response to therapy; and the interplay of crack cocaine use and associated co-occurring epidemics (mental health, poverty, unemployment and interpersonal violence with uptake of optimal antiretroviral therapy and engagement and retention in care.           By coupling the diverse population base of HIV-infected and at risk women with the recognized strengths in HIV/AIDS research, the Miami WIHS is perfectly situated to advance the overall WIHS scientific agenda of defining clinical outcomes among women across their lifespan, including the uptake of antiretroviral therapy; use and retention of HIV primary care and other ancillary services; treatment outcomes on viral suppression, immune recovery and normalization of the effects of HIV, and disease pathogenesis, as well as, promoting and advancing local scientific research goals.

1 U01 AI103401-01,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the AIDS epidemic has matured a disproportionate number of new infections are occurring in the Southeastern US. As such, the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) cohort is expanding to include a new site in the Southeast to make the cohort more representative. Alabama and Mississippi are located in the heart of the Deep South and have some of the highest rates of new HIV cases annually, especially among minority women. Barriers to access to care are among the worst in the US, and the prevalence of obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and health care disparities most pronounced. Therefore, establishing a new WIHS site in this area of the country will provide the opportunity to assess the 'new' epidemic of AIDS as it is emerging today. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) has a rich tradition of AIDS research, dating back to the mid-1980s. As the epidemic has matured, UAB scientists have established expertise in the socio-behavioral factors that propagate the epidemic, including barriers to testing, linkage to care, retention in care, and stigma. UAB scientists have emerged as leaders in innovative cohort research that evaluate the long term outcomes and comparative effectiveness of regimens via multisite cohort studies (e.g., CNICS, NA-ACCORD, ART-CC, and FRAM). By creating a linkage to the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) as a subunit partner, we take full advantage of their years of expertise in HIV clinical care, outreach, and cohort research. Collectively, we represent an ideal addition for WIHS both in terms of scientific expertise and representation of the current HIV epidemic in the US. The Specific Aims for our new WIHS site are: 1. To assess psychosocial barriers to HIV prevention behaviors, testing, linkage to care, and retention in care among recently diagnosed women in the Deep South. 2. To evaluate the influence of hormonal contraception and body fat mass on immune hyperactivation and accelerated immunosenescence in HIV-1 infected women. 3. To determine the interplay between co-existing HPV subspecies and the vaginal microbiome in creating conditions favorable to the expression of cervical dysplasia and malignancy 4. To explore changes in the gut microbiome ('dysbiosis') occurring as a consequence of chronic HIV infection and its treatment. 5. To elucidate nutritional, host genetic, metabolic, and cultural factors that are contributing to the rapid emergence of obesity as a highly prevalent condition among HIV infected women 6. To recruit and retain a cohort of 300 women, half of whom are HIV seropositive and half well-matched HIV-negative controls, who are strategically selected to enable the conduct of the research projects proposed above while simultaneously meeting the needs of the WIHS cohort.

1 U01 AI103408-01,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atlanta, due to the large size of its HIV epidemic, will serve as the ideal site to recruit HIV-infected and at-risk women who are representative of the Southern epidemic into the Women's Interagency Health Study (WIHS). Inclusion of Atlanta will expand the WIHS research expertise and agenda to include areas for which the Emory faculty are leading experts nationally. The potential of an Emory CRS is evident from the experience and excellent track record in the accrual of hundreds of women into HIV research including the DAIDS supported networks (ACTG, HPTN, HVTN) trials, and from the availability of state-of-the-art research capacity relevant to women's health (colposcopy, DXA and fMRI, carotid intima ultrasound, cardiac CT, local specimen repository, etc.). The size of our HIV clinical activities, which include 7,921 patients (22% women), 950 whom are newly diagnosed and antiretroviral treatment naive, offers a unique opportunity to diversify the WIHS cohort. Through long-standing collaboration between Emory investigators, county health departments, and community based organizations in the state, the Emory WIHS CRS will attract eligible subjects from rural Georgia and from the hard-to-reach communities to better characterize the changing demographics of the epidemic in the South. Innovative approaches guided by principles aligned with community-based participatory research will be employed to recruit, link, and retain women in the WIHS cohort. The overarching focus of the Emory WIHS application is ""HIV/AIDS secondary prevention for women through immunological, clinical, pharmacological, epidemiological and behavioral research."" Our vision is to make major contributions in effective behavioral and clinical interventions, and explore immunologic, epidemiological and pharmacological activities confronting women living with HIV. This vision is operationalized in our multisite research proposal ""The Emory SWEET Trial,"" an innovative implementable smartphone intervention designed to enhance antiretroviral adherence, promote harm reduction, reduce STDs incidence, and improve overall clinical and biomedical outcomes among HIV-infected and at-risk women. The site-specific projects engage the expertise of leading scientists at Emory to explore using the local WIHS cohort, the intracellular pharmacokinetics of commonly used antiretroviral drugs in HAART and PrEP, define the dyadic features that impact the lives of women living with HIV through couple voluntary counseling and HIV testing, and examine B cell subsets, PD- 1 expression, and serologic memory in peripheral blood and the female genital tract of HIV-infected women, to better characterize the impact of HIV infection on genital mucosal immunity.

1 ZIA AI001040-06,"The introduction of HIV antiretroviral medication (ARVs) in Africa has resulted in substantial reductions in morbidity and mortality. This project is studying the impact of ARVs on community level incidence in the Rakai Community Cohort Study in Uganda, the impact of ARVs on HIV transmission among HIV discordant couples, impact of immunologic monitoring and potential delays in detecting virologic failure on genotypic antiretroviral resistance, and the role of suppressive acyclovir therapy in HSV-2/HIV-1 co-infected individuals on HIV-1 disease progression. We have shown complete elimination of transmission among discordant couples on ARVs and continue to scale up treatment.  We have observed declining incidence among Rakai cohort participants since the introduction of ARVs and safe male circumcision with an even greater decline among men (benefiting from both MMC and exposure to female partners on treatment) supporting the current scale up of combination HIV prevention.  One concern with increased use of ARVs in sub-Saharan Africa is the extent by which viral resistance will develop over time among the non-clade B HIV-1-infected individuals. We analyzed antiretroviral drug susceptibility in HIV from 38 participants failing first and second line antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens in Rakai, Uganda. At baseline, four (13%) of 31 participants had mutations associated with resistance to either nucleoside or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs or NNRTIs). Most participants failing first-line ART had mutations to NNRTIs (86%) and lamivudine (81%), but only 22% had other NRTI mutations. None of the six participants failing a second-line protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen had PI resistance mutations. Six (16%) of the participants had discordant genotypic and phenotypic test results.  Concern has also been raised regarding the potential impact of hormonal contraception and the risk of virologic failure in women.  Consistent with current World Health Organization guidelines, we found no deleterious effect of injectable contraceptive use on response to ART in our cohort.    Viral load monitoring (VLM) to identify individuals failing ART is not widely available in resource-limited settings; most programs use clinical or immunological monitoring (IM) only. We compared the genotypic resistance patterns between patients with VLM to those with IM in Kampala, Uganda. 559 antiretroviral naive clients were enrolled in a prospective cohort, initiated ART, and monitored with viral load and CD4+ cell counts every 6 months (VLM group). From February 2008 through June 2009, 998 clients on ART for 36-40 months and immunologically monitored with CD4+ cell counts every 6 months were recruited into a cross sectional study (IM group). Virologic failure rates at 12, 24 and 36 months in the VLM group were 12%, 6% and 8% respectively, and 10% in the IM group at 36-40 months. 59% patients in the VLM group compared to 90% in the IM group, (P<0.0001) had at least 1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase mutation. Routine viral load monitoring during the first 3 years of ART reduced the rate of accumulated genotypic resistance to commonly used ART in Uganda. Early viral load monitoring may also offer an additional tool to improve adherence and reduce the risk of virologic failure.  Of 1,841 patients with at least 48 weeks of follow-up, 1,699 (92%) had an undetectable VL at 24 weeks (early suppressors).  Of the remaining 142 (8%) patients who had a detectable VL at 24 weeks, 60% of whom went on to be undetectable at 48 weeks (late suppressors). The majority of late suppressors (84%) remained suppressed well beyond 48 weeks.  Variables significantly predicting non-suppression by 48 weeks included: 24 week VL>2,000 copies/ml (OR=7.9; 95% CI 3.6-17.4) and age <30 (OR=2.8; 95% CI 1.3-6.2). The majority of patients with detectable VL at 24 weeks went on to full suppression which remained durable well beyond 48 weeks.     We have continued to ex"
1 ZIA BC010297-16,"The goal of this project is to identify genetic and epigenetic factors contributing to human infectious diseases. HIV, EBV, and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) contribute to AIDS-associated malignancies, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), respectively. Little is understood about the interplay between chronic viral infection and host genetic variation leading to pathogenic outcomes in persons infected with these viruses. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed that HLA class I alleles are most strongly associated with HBV clearance, HIV control of viral load, and with NPC. However, HLA explains only a small fraction of the variance for these infections and cancers. In addition, with advancing age of the HIV-infected population, diseases commonly associated with aging and affecting all organ systems are appearing at younger ages. We are embarking on genetic association studies to identify correlates of eye disease in the Longitudinal Study of Ocular Complications with AIDS (LSOCA) and of HIV-associated non-AIDS serious diseases in longitudinal natural and treated cohorts. Our laboratory is moving to integrate epigenetic signatures, gene expression, and results of GWAS and pathway analysis in a systems-based approach to further define genes and pathways important in the pathophysiology and carcinogenesis of infectious diseases. Accomplishments 1. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a major AIDS-defining condition and a common complication of immunosuppression. Chromosome 3p21-22 harbors two clusters of chemokine receptor genes, several of which serve as major or minor coreceptors of HIV-1. We resequenced 7 chemokine receptors in 144 individuals representing extreme phenotypes for HIV progression and infection; six codon-changing SNPs were discovered. We identified a non-conservative amino acid change in CCRL2 (Y167F) associated with more rapid progression to AIDS defining conditions, and specifically to the AIDS-defining condition PCP. CCRL2 is involved in lung dendritic cell trafficking and may affect PCP by inducing inflammation. This is the first genetic association with a major AIDS defining condition and brings renewed attention to the chemokine-chemokine receptor nexus in HIV pathogenesis. Highlighting the role of inflammation may lead to better therapeutic options for persons presenting with PCP infection. The results of this study were published in PLoS Genetics. 2. GWAS is an agnostic, unbiased method for detecting genetic factors associated with disease and traits. Because of the large number of tests, rigorous criteria for genome wide significance (by convention, p&lt;5 x 10-8) and independent replication are critical to avoid false positive associations. Since the number of persons with longitudinal clinical and laboratory data for infectious diseases is generally limited, the discovery of genetic factors associated with infectious disease phenotypes is problematic. To overcome this barrier, we have joined forces with the International HIV Consortium to contribute genotype-phenotypes from over 1000 HIV-infected participants with longitudinal follow-up for a meta-analysis. We are also part of the analytical team for viral load and CD4 T cell trajectories for this international collaboration. We are currently in the process of rigorous quality control (QC) for the genotype calls for three previous CCR GWAS for HBV and HIV clinical outcomes and for NPC. Using the ISHAPE software, we have determined the haplotype structure of participants enrolled in the NPC, HIV, and HBV studies with GWAS data. The next step will be to impute SNPs not represented on the Affymetric chip using data from the International HapMap Program and the 1000 Genome Project representing the major continental populations. With the enriched SNPs, we will reanalyze the data for association with multiple phenotypes using the 5 natural history cohorts and the LSOCA cohort, including HIV-asso"
1 ZIA BC010791-07,"Variation within the HLA class I genes of the MHC has the greatest impact on outcome after HIV infection relative to the rest of the genome. The first HIV GWAS identified a genome-wide significant effect of rs9264942 on HIV set point viral load that was independent of all other significant hits in the region, a finding that was confirmed in subsequent studies comparing HIV controllers to noncontrollers. This variant is located 35 Kb upstream of the HLA-C locus, and is in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the HLA-C coding region in people of European descent, but not in those of African ancestry. It is also associated with levels of HLA-C expression. We subsequently identified a microRNA (miRNA) binding site in the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of HLA-C, which is polymorphic and likely explains the differential cell surface expression of HLA-C across the various allotypes. Variation in this binding site is in near perfect linkage disequilibrium with rs9264942. We also showed that the variation in the miR binding site associates strongly with HIV viral load control. These findings are significant because prior to this, variation within the HLA-C locus was not considered to be much of a driving force in HIV restriction. Individual allelic effects of HLA-C are minimal in comparison to those at HLA-B. However, unlike HLA-B and HLA-A, HLA-C molecules are not down-regulated by HIV Nef, which allows ""normal"" recognition of infected cells by CTL restricted by HLA-C molecules. There still remains the question as to whether or not HLA-C expression levels have a direct influence on HIV control. If this is indeed the case, then we expect to observe the effect across ethnic groups, despite their distinct HLA-C allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium (LD) relationships with HLA-A and -B alleles. In order to address this issue we characterized the differential cell surface expression levels of all common HLA-C allotypes and tested directly for effects of HLA-C expression on outcomes of HIV infection in over 5000 individuals. Increasing HLA-C expression was associated with protection against multiple outcomes independently of individual HLA allelic effects in both African and European Americans, regardless of their distinct HLA-C frequencies and linkage relationships with HLA-B and HLA-A. Further, higher HLA-C expression was correlated with increased likelihood of cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and frequency of viral escape mutation. The effect of HLA-C expression level in HIV disease raises the possibility of its involvement in the risk of other human diseases. We tested this possibility in case-control cohorts of two inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). High HLA-C expression had a deleterious effect in Crohn's disease, suggesting a broader influence of HLA expression levels in human disease. Thus, the complexity of HLA effects in disease pathogenesis go beyond peptide specificity to include the strength of immune responses as dictated by levels of HLA expression. Comparing the frequency differences between common DNA variants in disease-affected cases and in unaffected controls has been successful in uncovering the genetic component of multiple diseases. Multiple GWAS have been performed in HIV-1 infected individuals, identifying common genetic influences on viral control and disease course. We were part of a large collaborative network of cohorts and institutions involved in HIV-1 host genetic studies that sought to test for common genetic polymorphisms that influence HIV-1 acquisition. Genome-wide SNP data on over 6,300 HIV-1 infected patients of European ancestry was combined for this analysis. After imputation using the 1,000 Genomes Project reference panel, approximately 8 million common DNA variants (SNPs and indels) were tested for association with HIV-1 acquisition in 6,334 infected patients and 7,247 population samples of European ancestry. Initial association testing ide"
1 ZIA BC010792-07,"Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LILR) B3 and LILRA6 represent a pair of inhibitory/activating receptors with identical extracellular domains and unknown ligands. LILRB3 can mediate inhibitory signaling via immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) in its cytoplasmic tail whereas LILRA6 can signal through association with an activating adaptor molecule, FcRgamma, which bears a cytoplasmic tail with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). The receptors are encoded by two highly polymorphic neighboring genes within the Leukocyte Receptor Complex (LRC) on human chromosome 19. We undertook a comprehensive genetic analysis of the LILRB3/A6 locus and investigated gene-specific expression. The data confirm the presence of high levels of non-synonymous variation in both genes with the majority of polymorphic sites being identical. In addition, the LILRA6 gene exhibits copy number variation (CNV) whereas LILRB3 does not. A screen of healthy Caucasians indicated that 32% of the subjects possessed more than 2 copies of LILRA6, whereas 4% have only one copy of the gene per diploid genome. Thus it is apparent that this locus has been subjected to non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) over time, resulting in variable copy numbers of the activating LILRA6 gene, but maintenance of a single fixed copy of the inhibitory LILRB3 gene.. Analysis of mRNA expression in the major fractions of PBMCs showed that LILRA6 is primarily expressed in monocytes, similarly to LILRB3, and its expression level correlates with copy number of the gene. We suggest that the LILRA6 CNV may influence the level of the activating receptor on the cell surface, potentially affecting signaling upon LILRB3/A6 ligation. The human KIR genes are arranged in at least six major gene-content haplotypes, all of which are combinations of four centromeric and two telomeric motifs. Several less frequent or minor haplotypes also exist, including insertions, deletions, and hybridization of KIR genes derived from the major haplotypes. These haplotype structures and their concomitant linkage disequilibrium among KIR genes suggest that more meaningful correlative data from studies of KIR genetics and complex disease may be achieved by measuring haplotypes of the KIR region in total. Previous studies of the KIR region have yielded detailed information about KIR haplotype structures derived uniquely from complete phased genomic sequences, revealing substructures of known haplotypes and further defined linkage among the KIR genes. Taking into account the many reported correlations between KIR polymorphism and disease, there is some imperative to incorporate KIR haplotype structures, including potential intraregion epistasis, into the association studies so that causative variation at KIR can be identified. In addition, the repetitive gene content structure of the KIR region may contribute to rapid evolution through aberrant recombination mechanisms, possibly driven by the immune function of KIR and providing further impetus towards understanding overall genomic region variation. Towards that end, a KIR haplotyping method developed by our collaborators that reports unambiguous combinations of KIR gene-content haplotypes, including both phase and copy number for each KIR was utilized. A total of 37 different gene content haplotypes were detected from 4,512 individuals and new sequence data was derived from haplotypes where the detailed structure was not previously available. An additional 10 haplotypes were detected in single copy but were not confirmed by sequencing. The 37 KIR haplotypes were sorted into 10 types of structural alterations, including gene deletions, insertions, and hybridizations, which together suggest a number of recombination events that might have occurred during KIR evolution. These new structures suggest a number of specific recombinant events during the course of KIR evolution, and add to an expanding diversity ofpotential n"
1 ZIA BC011058-06,"Immunization with live, replication-competent Ad-HIV or Ad-SIV envelope recombinant vaccines primes strong antibody responses that develop following administration of booster immunizations with envelope protein. These antibodies display a variety of functional activities. The most desirable for an HIV/AIDS vaccine is neutralizing activity that is able to prevent infection following exposure to the virus. We have elicited such antibodies in the rhesus macaque model that conferred apparent sterilizing immunity following challenge with an HIV/SIV chimeric SHIV virus. Our vaccine regimen also elicits antibodies with other functional activities mediated by Fc-receptor bearing cells such as NK cells. HIV/SIV infection is initially manifested as small foci of infected cells. Within 2 to 6 days, virus spreads from these cell foci to draining lymph nodes, subsequently leading to systemic infection. These additional functional activities can help control of the initial viral burden by limiting the spread of virus from these foci of infection. Such activities include antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and antibody dependent cell-mediated viral inhibition (ADCVI). Our recent studies demonstrate that these non-neutralizing antibody activities are correlated with lower viral burdens. Since HIV is transmitted mainly at rectal/genital mucosal sites, a key goal of HIV vaccine development is to elicit mucosal immunity. The Ad-recombinant prime/protein boost strategy induces antibodies in mucosal secretions which can inhibit transcytosis of SIV across an epithelial cell barrier, suggesting another mechanism which may contribute to protection. We have shown that vaccine-elicited viral-specific mucosal IgA antibodies are correlated with delayed infection following challenge with infectious SIV. The goal of vaccination is to develop immune memory. We have developed methodology to investigate memory B cells, which secrete antibodies. The ability of vaccines to elicit long lasting memory B cells is a critical property if immunization is to provide long-lasting, and potentially life-long protection. We have comprehensively investigated the dynamics of memory B cells in blood and tissues of SIV-infected rhesus macaques during treatment and therapeutic immunization. The knowledge gained will facilitate our further design and evaluation of vaccine strategies. We have shown that the quality of the antibody response and the level of anamnestic response following viral exposure are key features that impact a protective outcome. Overall, our recent studies continue to demonstrate that our vaccine strategy induces long-lasting, high-titered antibodies with a spectrum of activities both in serum and mucosal secretions, which together contribute to strong protection against viral challenge in non-human primate models. These findings have advanced the approach toward phase I clinical trials of the HIV/AIDS vaccine."
1 ZIA BC011426-02,"We have a long-standing interest in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and, more recently, have begun work on another essential viral enzyme, integrase (IN). Although much of our work is focused on understanding the mechanisms that underlie drug resistance, and using that information to develop more effective anti-HIV drugs, we are, in both the RT and IN projects, doing experiments that are intended to better understand the roles that these enzymes play in viral replication. We are also using redirected HIV integration as a tool to investigate chromatin structure and function. BACKGROUND: HIV-1 is the causative agent of AIDS. The three viral enzymes - RT, IN, and protease (PR) - have essential roles in the replication of HIV-1 and are the targets for all of the most potent anti-HIV drugs. Although considerable progress has been made in treating HIV-infected patients with three- and four-drug regimens, there is an immediate need for the development of effective ways to prevent new infections. A potent preventive vaccine would be ideal; however, despite a huge effort, the goal of developing an effective vaccine remains elusive. In the absence of an effective vaccine, reducing the transmission of HIV-1 must rely on barrier methods and/or drug treatments. There are two ways that anti-HIV drugs can be used to reduce viral transmission: (1) effective therapy in infected patients can reduce the viral load, making it less likely that an infected individual will transmit the virus to a partner; and (2) treating the uninfected partner with an anti-HIV drug can block transmission. Because most new infections are caused by a single virus, blocking transmission is an attractive option and there is now good evidence that giving an anti-HIV drug to the uninfected partner can significantly reduce viral transmission if the uninfected partner is compliant. Because of the problem of drug resistance, it would be better to use drugs with nonoverlapping resistance profiles for treatment and prophylaxis. Treatment would have to be long term and, for this reason, drug toxicity is an important consideration, which argues against the use of nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs). It would also be better to block infection before the viral DNA is integrated, which argues against the use of PR inhibitors. Therefore, the two remaining options among the major classes of anti-HIV drugs are nonnucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) and IN strand-transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). We are using a combined approach that involves structural analysis, biochemistry, virology, modeling, toxicity testing, and chemistry to design, synthesize, and evaluate new NNRTIs and INSTIs. We have made good progress in developing new compounds that are effective against the wild-type (WT) and common drug-resistant viruses and that have good therapeutic indexes in tests done in cultured cells. Our progress with the IN research is reported below; progress with the HIV-1 RT research is reported separately for Project ZIA BC 010481. HIV-1 IN: Like RT, HIV-1 IN is an important drug target; however, as is the case for all anti-HIV drugs, treatment with INSTIs leads to resistance. We are making good progress on two fronts: understanding how mutations in IN confer resistance to the currently available compounds, and developing new INSTIs that are effective against the common drug-resistance mutations. Dr. Terry Burke is synthesizing new anti-IN compounds; Dr. Yves Pommier is using biochemical assays to test Dr. Burke's anti-IN compounds in vitro (using purified recombinant IN); and we are testing how the new inhibitors affect viral replication and measuring their toxicity in cultured cells. Until quite recently, we had no structural information to guide the development of IN inhibitors. However, Dr. Peter Cherepanov has obtained high-resolution structures of full-length foamy virus (FV) IN in complexes with both DNA substrates and anti-IN drugs. Dr. Cherepanov has joined our collaborative effort and has "

1 ZIA CP010152-14,"The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial is a large randomized trial to determine if screening for these cancers reduces mortality.  The Trial is carried out by the NCI under contract with investigators at ten clinical centers in the United States.  The study includes approximately 155,000 volunteers (recruited from 1993 through 2001, ages 55-74, equally distributed to the screening and control arms of the Trial).  The PLCO Etiology and Early Markers Study (EEMS) supports etiologic and early detection studies of cancers and other conditions.  EEMS uses data and samples collected in the context of the PLCO Trial including:1.  Baseline demographic and risk factor information on all participants,2.  Food Frequency Questionnaires(FFQ) on all participants3.  Fractionated blood specimens at each of six screening rounds from screened participants,4.  Buccal cell samples from control participants, and5.  Information on all-cancer incidence and selected other medical conditions.Investigations in PLCO EEMS have shown dietary-related factors associated with adenoma risk, including dietary fiber, meat cooking practices, serum selenium, low calcium intake, and a gene variant in the calcium-sensing receptor.  Tobacco use was strongly related to adenoma risk, with evidence of risk modification by genes involved in the metabolism of PAH and aromatic amine constituents of tobacco smoke.  Other factors associated with risk of colorectal adenoma included insulin-like growth factors and selected DNA repair-related polymorphisms.  Prostate cancer risk was related to vegetable intake, particularly cruciferous vegetables, while dietary and serum lycopene were unrelated to risk.  Supplemental vitamin E and serum alpha-tocopherol were related to risk only in smokers, consistent with other reports; serum selenium was also related to risk in smokers only. High-temperature cooked meat containing 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) led to increased risk, while only the highest levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were related to prostate cancer.  Genetic studies of candidate genes in the PLCO Trial have revealed associations with SNPs in SHBG and risk of prostate cancer.  Through the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3) are evaluating prostate and breast cancer risks related to gene variants in steroid hormone and insulin-like growth factor pathways.  Investigations in BPC3 and the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) project are identifying prostate cancer risks associated with gene variants in the 8q24 region.  Colon adenoma studies are now being expanded to consider the etiology of colon cancer, also in collaboration with other research groups.

1 ZIA DA000175-19,"The Treatment Section continues its long-term projects to improve treatment for substance dependence through behavioral, pharmacologic, and combined behavioral and pharmacologic interventions.    We completed a clinical trial examining the effectiveness of individualized methadone dosages of 100 to 190 mg/day, compared in a randomized, double-blind design with fixed dosages of 100 mg/day.  Surprisingly, polydrug use (effect-size h = .30) and heroin craving (effect-size d = .87) were significantly greater in the individualized high-dose group than in the fixed-dose group, with no trend toward lower heroin use in the individualized high-dose group.  This counterintuitive finding requires replication, but supports the need for additional controlled studies of high-dose methadone.    We also completed a double-blind interventional study of propranolol on cue-induced cocaine craving, in which a single administration of propranolol was intended to block reconsolidation of cocaine-associated emotional responses, thereby leading to an enduring reduction in cue-induced craving.  Again, the results were unexpected.  Cue reactivity, as assessed by craving scales and physiological responses, was unexpectedly greater in the propranolol group than in the placebo group.  This counter-hypothesized group difference was present both acutely after propranolol administration and during the subsequent test sessions. Our results do not support the use of propranolol for cue-induced cocaine craving in opioid-maintained patients.    We also developed and deployed a video-based smartphone-delivered mobile HIV Risk Reduction (mHIVRR) intervention.  We developed 3 video modules that consisted of a 10-minute HIVRR video, 11 acceptability questions, and 3 knowledge questions and deployed them as a secondary study within a larger study of ecological momentary and geographical momentary assessment.  All 24 individuals who remained in the main study long enough completed the mHIVRR secondary study. All 3 videos met our a priori criteria for acceptability as is in the population: they achieved median scores of &#8804;2.5 on a 5-point Likert scale; &#8804;20% of individuals gave them the most negative rating on the scale; and a majority of individuals stated they would not prefer other formats over video-based smartphone-delivered (all p<0.05). Additionally, all of our video modules met our a priori criteria for feasibilty: &#8804;20% of data were missing due to participant noncompliance and &#8804;20% were missing due to technical failure.  We concluded that video-based mHIVRR education delivered via smartphone is acceptable and feasible, and may increase HIV/STD risk reduction knowledge.  Future studies, with pre-intervention assessments of knowledge and random assignment, are needed to confirm these findings.    Finally we continue to develop Geographical Momentary Assessment (GMA), a descriptive approach to better measure and understand the relationships among mood, drug use, and environmental exposure to psychosocial stressors. We remain committed to transforming description into intervention. For example, we have shown that electronic-diary studies can provide amazing insight into the daily lives of substance abusers during treatment and data that are sensitive to behavioral changes during even brief periods of abstinence. The technologies that enable us to collect data on drug use, craving, and stress in the field may also be used for delivery of treatment in the field, perhaps in response to the patients own self-reported behaviors or previously identified triggers."

The results from autopsies are used to assess treatment response, to answer clinical questions at the time of death, to identify pathology that was unknown or misdiagnosed prior to death, and to provide for hospital and protocol quality assurance. In addition, when the use and study of human pathological material is requested by research staff of any of the categorical institutes, the Postmortem Section makes every effort to collaborate with and/or supply the researchers with the human tissues upon approved request. (The Laboratory of Pathology has a standard procedure for tissue requests.) The autopsy material is utilized by NIH staff and fellows for research projects involving clinicopathological correlation and characterization of disease processes. Currently, several projects are on-going: clinical-pathological studies in dementia; culture of tumor cells from post-mortem tumor specimens following rapid autopsy; MRI correlations with normal tissue and de-myelinating disease (multiple sclerosis); investigation into Job syndrome and chronic granulomatous disease and complications of graft-versus-host disease. A partial database of major autopsy findings from 1953 through the present is available and all findings from March, 1999 on are available on-line through the Laboratory of Pathology's Information System.

To accomplish this, the CRRC has developed specific resources to link participants recruited through the major UW-associated HIV clinics in Seattle (or samples and data from them) to individual HIV investigators. The CRRC will accomplish its mission in five ways: First, for investigators seeking eligible research subjects to enroll in specific studies, the CRRC will continue the highly successful Research Referral Service. Second, for translational investigators seeking human specimens, the CRRC will use two approaches with complementary strengths: 1) a more limited version of the existing HIV Specimen Repository with prospective follow-up and routine specimen and data collection, and 2) an enhanced version of the existing Special Specimen Collection Service with specific project-directed collection of specimens and data. Third, to address the need for control specimens from HIV-negative persons, the CRRC will establish a new registry of HIV negative patients interested in participating in HIV research studies. Fourth, to support laboratory analyses for specific HIV studies, the CRRC will provide basic testing and develop specialized laboratory assays required for specific HIV studies. Finally, to accelerate the pace of planned studies and stimulate new directions of research, the CRRC will create and strengthen linkages with other UW CFAR cores and other CFARs (CNICS). Specifically, the CRRC will coordinate regular meetings with the immunology, clinical epidemiology and computational biology cores to scrutinize and integrate requests for services made to any of the cores and maximize efficient and novel uses of samples and laboratory testing capacity."

The UCLA CFAR Clinical Research Facilitation Core (Core L) provides support for investigators and their staff who are engaged in research involving human subjects with an overall goal to reduce the time between project funding and the initiation and completion of the research. The core has 2 specific aims: 1) To assist investigators with the regulatory approval aspects of biomedical, behavioral and basic translational patient-oriented research in HIV; 2) To establish and maintain a continually-updated research participants' registry that will assist investigators with identifying and enrolling subjects into patient-oriented HIV research at UCLA. This core has created a streamlined process for IRB and other regulatory filing and established a v/ay to identify and contact potential research subjects, which reduces costs and the time needed to receive various institutional regulatory approvals and to identify potential subjects for their research. In addition new clinical and translational faculty as well as fellows and postdoctoral students receive training from this core in human subjects regulatory requirements, in proper IRB and other required submissions and how best to recruit for subjects from the diverse and often hard-to-reach populations of HIV-infected and at-risk individuals in the greater LA community. The core provides UCLA investigators, research trainees and staff access to resources that would otherwise not be available or which may be unaffordable to help expedite their research. The UCLA CFAR Clinical Research Facilitation Core also provides valuable recruitment and enrollment tools which help both existing and new faculty expedite their research and which serves as an attractive value added resource for the recruitment and retention of faculty working in HIV at UCLA.

The RSVP program, initiated in late 2011, is in its subject recruitment and implementation phase. We intend to expand and make it more widely available with this competitive renewal."
2 P30 AI036214-19A1-7349,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Core A - The Administrative Core organizes and maintains the policies and procedures of the CFAR as a whole, thereby ensuring the efficient operation and management of the Center. To support an effective Center, the Core maintains close ties with University officials, specifically the Office of Contracts and Grants and the Dean's office. The CFAR is multi-institutional; the Administrative Core fosters participation, interaction and collaboration among its members at UCSD, the Salk Institute, The Scripps Research Institute and La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology. Because the CFAR is also a multidisciplinary center, the Core works closely with the UCSD Antiviral Research Center, the Owen Clinic, the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program, as well as other HIV programs, and coordinates outreach and educational activities. With the cooperation and support of the Directors and the Administrative staff, this Core aims to build an efficient infrastructure to streamline policies and procedures for long-term operations. Specifically, the Core will (1) provide effective coordination and communication among Core Directors, CFAR members, trainees and the community; (2) provide expert fiscal management and reporting to Core Directors, grant recipients, the University and the NIH; (3) create and maintain the CFAR website; (4) organize and publicize Scientific Focus Group meetings, (5) publish the online newsletter; (6) organize educational and outreach activities to CFAR members and the community; and (7) coordinate strategic planning to plan for evolving scientific opportunities and member needs.

2 P30 AI036214-19A1-7350,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Core B - The developmental component of the UCSD CFAR is designed to facilitate and encourage new investigators and new ideas in HIV/AIDS research. The intent is to optimize opportunities for productive research by providing immediate financial support in association with resource support provided by the Core facilities. Three categories of developmental grants will be supported, although the number and type of these categories are flexible: (1) foster junior investigators; (2) support newly-recruited faculty involved with HIV-related research; and (3) respond rapidly to evolving research opportunities.   Requests for submission of developmental grants are advertised through the Administrative Core twice a year for funding in January and July. Faculty at all four CFAR member institutions are eligible to apply. The submissions are evaluated by an expert review committee and additional ad hoc reviewers who are experts in the pertinent fields as needed. Scientific merit is the primary criterion for making the awards; however, fostering the development of junior investigators is an important programmatic goal that is also considered in prioritization of awards. The maximum amount for the awards currently given is $50,000 for unfunded junior investigators and $30,000 for others. Grants to senior investigators must receive prior approval from the NIAID CFAR Program Office. As part of their award, investigators are required to provide documentation of publications and peer-reviewed funding that result from the developmental awards. They are also required to cite CFAR developmental funds in publications resulting from work supported by developmental grants.  The Developmental Core also coordinates the NCI-funded pilot grants in HIV malignancies, in partnership with the UCSD Moores Cancer Center. The CFAR and Cancer Center issue joint requests for applications and conduct joint reviews. The Developmental Core coordinates the CFAR portion of this collaboration.    The Developmental Core has an active and effective mentorship program. With the growth of the CFAR, anticipate a greater number of innovative and timely projects will be funded, attracting new members and affiliates who can advance HIV and AIDS research."

A prime goal is to provide the scientific environment and the material resources to enable junior investigators to apply flow cytometry technology to their projects and to encourage established investigators to initiate innovative pilot studies. Core personnel include: the Director, Celsa Spina, PhD, D(ABMLI); a lab manager/senior technologist, with >10 yrs. experience using a broad range of cytometry instruments (T. Rambaldo); two technical specialists, each with >20 yrs. experience (M. O'Keefe, N. Sekiya); and a junior technician, with 4 yrs. experience (D. Sirypangno). Major instrumentation includes: three cell analyzers (2-laser FACS Canto I, 3-laser FACS Canto II, 2-laser iCyte LSC) and two high-speed cell sorters (3-laser FACS Aria II, 4-laser MoFlo XDP), one of which is housed within a BSL-2/3 biocontainment facility.   The spectrum of HIV/AIDS research, supported by the Core, spans basic work on viral regulation and mechanisms of pathogenesis (AI038201, AI081668, AI095623, AI096113, DK035108, GM032373) to preclinical development of drugs, vaccines, and gene therapies (AI033292, AI055332, AI071803, AI076558, AI079031) to clinical studies of viral transmission (AI074621), viral latency (AI080193, AI096113), neurobiology (DA026306, MH083552, MH097520), and immune and viral responses to experimental treatments (AI064086, AI087164, MH085610). To support and promote research in each of these areas: expert consultation on experimental design and data interpretation is provided through the Core Director and technical support staff; state-of-the-art instrumentation is selected for complementary functions; equipment use is accessible through dedicated technician operators; all services are provided through an established recharge mechanism; and data analysis is customized to the specific objectives of individual research projects. The Core works with investigators to develop and apply new methods that are needed to attain the research goals of funded projects, and trains junior investigators to optimally and correctly use flow cytometry approaches to address their research hypotheses. In addition, the Core fills a special need of the San Diego HIV research community by providing a unique biocontainment facility that performs live cell sorting of HIV-infected and other biohazardous samples."
2 P30 AI036214-19A1-7352,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):   Core E - The principal objective of the Genomics and Sequencing (GS) Core of the Center for AIDS research (CFAR) at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) is to facilitate the research of HIV/AIDS investigators by providing cost-effective access to cutting-edge genomics and sequencing technologies. The GS Core will help investigators realize the enormous potential of these approaches to assist basic and applied research into the role of host and viral genes in HIV infection and pathogenesis, leading to new insights and treatments. Support for developmental projects and investigators new to HIV research is an area of special emphasis. The specific aims of the GS Core are: (1) to develop and provide molecular tools and resources to HIV researchers for the determination of host and viral mechanisms of pathogenesis, (2) to guide HIV researchers in the value, use, and interpretation of genetic information and gene expression data, and (3) to facilitate education and training in genomics and sequencing technologies for CFAR investigators, students, staff, and other researchers. The GS Core will achieve these aims by providing: (1) assays for gene expression, viral detection and quantitation for research purposes, genetic variation, tools for functional genomics (e.g., siRNA expressing vectors), sequencing and/or deep sequencing of virus, host, transcriptome, or small RNAs, and provision of useful reagents to researchers, (2) analysis of gene expression and genetic variation, help with open source and proprietary tools for alignment and comparison of sequences, and collaboration with the Bioinformatics and Information Technologies (BIT) Core in molecular phylogeny studies, application-specific high throughput sequencing (HTS) pipelines, or more advanced data analysis, and (3) seminars, workshops, and individual training for graduate students and fellows, web resources, and mentoring of undergraduate independent study students.    The GS Core will serve as an important resource for basic and translational HIV-related research, as best exemplified by 129 publications and 211 investigators supported by the combined services of the Genomics and Molecular Biology Cores since the last renewal. All evidence indicates the GS Core will be a valuable, productive, and popular basic science core for the UCSD CFAR."
2 P30 AI036214-19A1-7353,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Core G - The Clinical Investigation and Biostatistics (CB) Core supports and enables studies of the pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of HIV disease and its complications. The Core functions as a central access point for basic, clinical, and translational investigators by providing expertise in clinical study design, study implementation, patient recruitment, clinical evaluations for research, and specimen and data collection. Importantly, the Core provides biostatistical consultation for study design, grant preparation, power considerations and statistical analysis of study results as well as assistance with manuscript preparation. The CFAR web portal allows users to submit requests to the CB Core in a uniform, easy-to-use, and readily available format that ensures rapid response to requested services. A key innovation of the CB Core is the availability of prospectively collected, high quality, real-time clinical data, from the 3000 patients in current clinical care at the Owen Clinic, which is linked to a specimen repository and patient-based outcome measures (i.e., quality of life, adherence). The data and specimens allow for identification of and access to subjects and specimens that meet specific criteria for interventional, epidemiologic, behavioral, or basic science projects. The Core interacts with other CFAR cores to enable research requiring laboratory and clinical expertise, fosters multidisciplinary research among basic, clinical, and behavioral scientists, and teaches and mentors junior investigators in the principles of clinical investigation. CFAR funding permits the CB Core to offer its services to new and junior investigators without charge in most cases. Quality-assured data sets, with key data elements that have been reviewed for consistent definitions and accuracy, are provided free to the CFAR academic community. The resources from the CB Core have been further expanded and leveraged by collaboration with seven additional CFARs across the country to form the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). The specific aims of the CB Core are: to support clinical investigation and translational research; to encourage, mentor and train the next generation of HIV clinical investigators; and to provide education about and access to HIV-related research opportunities and CFAR research findings to all HIV-infected individuals, including women and underrepresented minorities in the CFAR community."

2 P30 AI036214-19A1-7356,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Core K - Current HIV research often requires reliable links between clinical and basic science investigators. These links include characterization and access to clinical specimens, laboratory based assays designed for clinical specimens, interpretation and management of generated data, and training in these areas. The Translational Virology (TV) Core of the UCSD CFAR is designed to be this reliable and cost-effective link. The TV Core accomplishes this goal for a wide range of HIV research-related activities involving: junior and senior investigators, established and burgeoning programs, clinical and basic science investigators, domestic and International efforts, NIH and other funders, etc. Over the past 4 years, the TV Core has provided services to 67 Investigators, contributed to 56 publications, helped 11 investigators obtain new or competing research awards and trained 48 individuals in safe laboratory procedures for working with HIV and PCR methodologies. Specifically, the TV Core provides services through four defined units that work closely with other CFAR Cores, as outlined: (1) Specimen Unit: obtains, processes, tracks, ships and cryostores samples, (primary collaborating Core: Clinical Investigation and Biostatistics) (2) Assay Unit: develops and provides a wide-range of clinically-relevant assays (HIV genotyping, viral loads, antibody and nucleic acid detection, etc.).

2 P30 AI036214-19A1-7357,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Core L - Scientific inquiry and public health are being fundamentally changed by immense volumes of complex data, and modern computational techniques that are able to mine these data for pattern discovery and inference. The field of HIV research is no exception, and many innovative discoveries have been facilitated or validated by sophisticated modeling and data analyses. Traditional biostatistics services are neither designed to handle gigantic volumes of complex data, nor are these new data types (e.g., next generation sequencing data) a natural fit for current computational biology and informatics applications. The purpose of the Bioinformatics and Information Technologies (BIT) is to handle CFAR investigator demand for storing, managing, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating large and complex data sets, especially those containing viral and host molecular sequences. Based on ongoing and anticipated future needs of CFAR members, in the next five years, the BIT Core is structured as three interlinked units that will: (1) provide bioinformatics support for CFAR researchers by leveraging world-class expertise in bioinformatics and computational biology available at UCSD to offer a comprehensive spectrum of services and consultations related to computational analyses of data collected by CFAR investigators; (2) supply content management systems, web services for biomedical data, and computational infrastructure; and (3) provide training in bioinformatics and information technology. The BIT Core is uniquely positioned to provide these innovative services to CFAR members by drawing upon cutting edge in-house methodological research, modern sequencing and biomedical technologies offered by other CFAR Cores (e.g. GS, PEP, Flow Cytometry Cores), and professional software development and support expertise of its programming team. The CFAR External Advisory Committee reviewed our Center in February, 2012 and noted the following about the BIT Core in their final report:"
2 R01 DA012568-15A1,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this competing renewal, we propose to continue a 25-year investigation of the epidemiology of HIV risk among HIV-uninfected injection drug users (IDUs) enrolled in the AIDS Linked to the IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE-II) Study in Baltimore, MD. This study has provided critical insight into the dynamics of HIV infection and risk behavior while serving as a comparison group to a parallel cohort of HIV positive IDUs (DA04334, ALIVE-I). Our investigative team has been highly productive during the past funding cycle (112 publications & 77 major presentations) and, over the next five years, we will continue cutting-edge and innovative broad- based investigations, while serving as a resource for clinical and pathogenesis studies related to HIV and HCV infection. In this proposal, we present a focused effort related to hepatitis C virus (HCV), which represents the major challenge that IDUs will face over the next decade. HCV prevalence ranges from 50-90% in IDU populations and morbidity and mortality secondary to HCV infection is expected to dramatically increase over the next decade. Building on lessons learned from HIV, we focus on collecting information to evaluate the population-level effectiveness of current HCV 'Test-and-Treat' initiatives and provide insight to the development of new interventions to target HCV testing, linkage to care, treatment and Treatment as Prevention (HCV-TasP). Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Characterize the continuum of care for HCV among IDUs and its evolution over time with increasingly efficacious antiviral therapy; 2) Assess population-level effectiveness of hepatitis C treatment among IDUs in Baltimore; 3) Develop a mathematical model of HCV treatment dynamics to assess the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of different intervention strategies; and 4) continue to serve as an HIV negative comparison group for longitudinal investigation of non-AIDS outcomes and a platform for independently funded related studies. To achieve these aims, we will continue follow-up of a cohort of HIV negative IDUs (~1000) with semiannual visits and will open recruitment twice over the proposed funding period. New recruitment will occur in 2013-2014 and 2016-2017; 500 participants at each time point will be accrued via street outreach. The ALIVE-II cohort is unique in that it comprises a community- based IDU population of both genders with significant representation of African-Americans and those with limited access to appropriate medical care; these populations have been underrepresented in research on persons at risk for HIV infection. We collaborate with ALIVE-I, a parallel cohort of HIV-infected IDUs that capitalizes on the same protocol, facilities and staff with no fiscal overlap. Given the scientific rigor of the proposed methods, existing infrastructure, experienced investigators and multiple NIH-funded ancillary studies, we anticipate continued success and substantial scientific contribution.

2 R01 DA015612-11,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite many recent advances in prevention and treatment interventions for HIV and substance use, policymakers and providers have been forced to confront a persistent insufficiency of funds and to make difficult choices from among competing claims on scarce resources. In this renewal application, we propose to continue our work to address emerging questions about global HIV prevention, treatment, and priority setting in substance-using populations. We will extend our prior epidemiologic modeling work by assessing portfolios of prevention and treatment interventions, by addressing these interventions in the context of co-epidemics (HIV, hepatitis C virus infection, and tuberculosis), and by developing resource allocation tools. The goal of our work is to use epidemiologic modeling to help decision makers optimize population health by providing information on the comparative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and affordability of alternative portfolio investments. Our aims are:  1. To estimate production functions that characterize the relationship between program expenditures and  health-related outcomes, such as reductions in transmission risk for prevention programs and the delivery  of services for treatment programs.  2. To develop model-based methods to translate the behavioral and biological impact of HIV-related interventions into epidemic outcomes, such as infections averted and years of life saved.  3. To determine how best to estimate health outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of HIV and  substance use interventions (for example, in the presence of co-epidemics).  4. To assess the individual- and population-level effectiveness, cost, cost-effectiveness, and budget  impact of specific interventions aimed at preventing and treating HIV and substance use and related  co-epidemics (e.g., HIV, HCV, and tuberculosis).  5. To inform the allocation of societal resources by examining the effectiveness and cost-  effectiveness of portfolios of prevention and treatment interventions in the context of the regional  epidemiology of disease.  6. To develop practical resource allocation tools for policymakers to assist them in making informed  investments of resources in HIV and substance use treatment and prevention programs. Our proposed research will develop innovative epidemiologic modeling methods for assessing portfolios of interventions; critically evaluate promising prevention and treatment interventions; advance the state of the art in HIV planning and policy modeling; and provide planners with innovative tools to assist them in informed allocation of scarce resources for HIV and substance use prevention and treatment. The proposed work will enable us to have broad impact on HIV and substance use policy in the U.S. and internationally.          "

2 U01 AI031834-21,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the HIV epidemic moves into its third decade it is increasingly a disease of older women who have age-related co-morbidities, and concomitant prolonged exposure to the virus, to ART, and to the metabolic consequences of both infection and therapy. The WIHS in general, and the Brooklyn site in particular, are ideally suited to address the most salient questions related to an aging female cohort. We propose three projects that capture important aspects of the HIV epidemic in aging women. Each project contains specific studies with their own sets of aims and hypotheses. Project 1 focuses on neurocognition, metabolic, and vascular factors in HIV and includes three studies: 1. Adipose tissue, genetic susceptibility, and neurocognition; 2. The HIV-Neuroimaging Initiative; 3. Vascular factors and neurocognition. Project 2 focuses on aging biomarkers in HIV and includes two studies: 1. Frailty-Physical, functional and neurocognitive aspects of aging; 2. Reproductive aging and telomeres. Project 3 focuses on behaviors and implementation science approaches to understanding and promoting successful aging in HIV. It includes three studies: 1. Life course transitions and care engagement; 2. An intervention to increase adherence among women who have experienced childhood sexual abuse; 3. An intervention to enhance smoking cessation. The Brooklyn site, the largest WIHS site, has an exceptional record in cohort retention as well as participation in WIHS leadership and substudies. We further energize our activities for WIHS-V by expanding our cadre of co-investigators and biostatisticians to include those with expertise matched to the aforementioned projects and studies. Dr. Minkoff, who has been chair of the WIHS EC for over a decade, will be joined in a dual-PI leadership role by Dr. Deborah Gustafson, a neuroepidemiologist who has worked with aging cohorts in Sweden and Argentina. Among the many new collaborators are Dr. David Keefe, Chair of OB/GYN at NYU and one of the nation's leaders in reproductive aging, and Dr. Richard Havlik who has served at the NIH in research related to aging. We will also collaborate with the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, led by Dr. Michael Weiner. These and other new investigators will join an array of established site investigators, including Dr. Tracey Wilson who heads the WIHS behavioral working group, Dr. Howard Crystal, a neurologist who has a WIHS-linked R01 and many others, to assure the scientific productivity of the site. We have also established a biostatistical core, with members whose expertise corresponds to our project needs, including Drs. Lanza and Yang (Penn State) and Dr. Wilson (SUNY) for analysis of the behavioral projects; Drs. Gustafson (SUNY), Nalls (Molecular Genetics Section, NIA, NIH), Donahue (UCSD) and Weedon (SUNY) for neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and genetic analyses; and Dr. Wu (Penn State) for telomere analysis. Given our exemplary track record to date, in conjunction with an innovative fusion of new and seasoned investigators, and an invigorated statistical core, we look forward to a continued productive relationship with our colleagues in WIHS.

2 U01 AI034989-20,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The WIHS is the largest and longest-duration cohort study of HIV infection in women in the U.S. The San Francisco Bay Area WIHS (SF WIHS) application is focused on continuing our contributions to WIHS: 1. Enrollment and retention of participants (including HIV+ women who are not in care) via a regional consortium and generation of complete and high quality data and specimens, 2. The vigorous participation of site investigators in the WIHS scientific process, and 3. Proposal of new aims that address key issues concerning processes and conditions associated with excess morbidity in HIV+ women in the current treatment era. The new aims feature special emphasis on vascular injury and pain and were selected because they concern key morbidities in potent antiretroviral therapy (cART) treated women, involve sex dimorphic  phenomena, and may be influenced by gonadal aging. Vascular measures include indicators of medium (Ankle Brachial Index) and very small vessel condition (measures of retinal vessel caliber). We put forward an increased focus on functional outcomes, including specific organ functional measures, and total physical  fitness and morphology (such as kyphosis). The pain studies take the unique approach of assessing what  participants mean when they report pain, assess genetic contributions and examine outcomes that include  physical function. We also propose to continue our work to measure long term exposure to antiretroviral  drugs (ARVs) using hair samples, which are producing high impact reports concerning the pharmacology of  ARVs in women and continuation of the WIHS Genetics Unit that was recently established in SF WIHS and is  conducting Genome-Wide Association Studies.

2 U01 AI034993-20,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the HIV Prevention Treatment Network 052 study proving that early antiretroviral (ART) initiation reduces rates of HIV sexual transmission and clinical events, and with women making up 50% of people living with HIV globally, a better understanding of how women with HIV start, stay on and respond to ART and how this therapy impacts prevention, treatment, and care/cure of HIV/AIDS is needed. African American women continue to bear the largest burden of HIV disease among women, with disproportionately higher rates of new HIV infections, AIDS diagnoses, and mortality. The major goal of this proposal is to continue the high level of productivity of the Chicago WIHS Consortium (CWC) as both a clinical research site and as a consortium of scientific leaders with a track record of advancing our understanding of the evolving HIV epidemic in US women. We will continue to rapidly recruit and retain a representative cohort of women with and at risk for HIV, to collect th highest quality data in order to lead and pursue innovative epidemiologic analyses, and multidisciplinary investigations to characterize treated HIV disease in women. Over the WIHS-V five year period, we will continue to design, implement, synthesize, and disseminate findings from investigations which explore the dynamic and complex relationships between HIV, ART, viral suppression, sociodemographics, behaviors, mental illness, immune biomarkers, menopausal stage, and comorbidities rather than focusing on the impact of any one single factor. The CWC investigative team proposes to expand and retain the Chicago cohort and to apply analytic modeling to longitudinal social/behavioral, clinical, neurocognitive, and pathogenesis data to develop and test a gender specific prognostic index (""WIHS Index""). We aim to identify psychological, neuroendocrine, genetic, and immunologic predictors of HIV disease phenotypes, including those characterized by inflammation, activation, and cellular senescence and determine the association with clinical and pre-clinical measures of HIV associated non AIDS (HANA) co-morbidities. Since evidence suggests that potentially modifiable factors, such as untreated mental illness, chronic life stress, and use of addictive substances can contribute to inflammation and accelerate telomere shortening, a key molecular marker of cellular senescence, we will explore the interactions between psychiatric diagnoses, hormonal patterns, and markers of the innate and adaptive immune system. Given the high rates of these modifiable factors in our cohort, we propose a multi-site randomized controlled trial to test an evidence based computerized tailored intervention based on the Transtheoretical Model to address risk behaviors concurrently aimed at smoking cessation, improving ART adherence, and effectively managing stress, depression, and weight. Through these WIHS V efforts, we hope to identify new tools that can be used at all levels of HIV care (community, clinic, and laboratory) to empower clinicians and their female patients to improve the prognosis and lives of women with HIV.

2 U01 AI034994-20,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1993, the Washington Metropolitan WIHS (WMW) Consortium has enrolled and retained a representative community cohort of HIV-infected and uninfected women with the purpose of supporting NIAID in understanding the current epidemiology of HIV, risk behaviors, disease progression, treatment uptake and outcomes, and related co-morbidities. The early cohort of infected women is aging, and the effects of age and menopausal status on disease outcomes and co-morbidities is yet to be elucidated. The WMW has joined with centers around the country and with sites across metropolitan Washington, DC to address these issues. This is particularly pertinent as Washington, DC has the highest prevalence of HIV of any urban center in the U.S. and the WMW has enrolled and retained a cohort that represents women both ethnically and psychosocially. The WMW has successfully participated in all elements of the WIHS protocol and has actively supported the infrastructure of the national WIHS. WMW investigators have participated in all of the major WIHS scientific initiatives. Additionally, with its rich data baseand local and national specimen repository, the WMW has supported local and national initiatives designed to understand the pathophysiology underlying co-morbidities. The WMW proposes to continue this work and to expand its research portfolio by continuing its strong collaborative relationship with the national WIHS in the area of protocol development, implementation, sub study participation, and identification of new initiatives. Additionally, for the next cycle of funing we have proposed new initiatives that include a telephone-based intervention for depression that will positively impact adherence and health behaviors with the goal of reducing community viral load. This intervention can easily be implemented in the larger DC community. We are expanding our local initiatives on HIV and HCV associated liver disease by engaging a team of researchers in exploring the host response, epigenetic factors, and protein glycosylation in liver disease and cancer. We will also continue and expand our investigations in organ specific morbidities associated with long-term survival in an aging population with the goal of reducing or preventing morbidity in the areas of vascular health, neurocognitive decline, and the vaginal immunologic response in aging. We will accomplish this by engaging with national and local investigators with proven expertise in these areas to further leverage the NIH investment in this important cohort of women. This will allow us to better define the status of women with HIV and bring to fruition the goals of an AIDS free generation and effective and sustainable treatment for those already infected.

2 U01 AI035004-20,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 2011 was a transformative year in HIV research, providing evidence and raising hope that the HIV epidemic globally can potentially be not only controlled but also effectively aborted in our lifetime through both prevention and cure. Effective  primary prevention through microbicides, pre-exposure prophylaxis and treatment of persons living with HIV (PLWH) seems within our reach. Equally important, basic science advances suggest that cure is possible through activation and/or elimination of HIV proviral DNA from host cells. We propose a WIHS scientific agenda that informs these possible routes to defeating HIV, through investigations of genital tract innate immune factors protecting against HIV-infection; identification of epigenetic changes in the provirus that may define a target for cure; and elucidating cell-to-cell viral transfer. We will continue to use WIHS's robust database to inform effective treatment for women and persons of African descent. Of the 34.0 million PLWH globally more than half of are women, and more than 75% are of African ancestry; nearly all studies of the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are in men of European descent. Thus, epidemiologic and translational investigation of population- based effectiveness of ART in WIHS, which is 100% women and >60% of African descent, will provide critical information for patients and providers both in the US and globally. Further, with 18 years of prospective data collection the WIHS is able to investigate clinical manifestations in aging populations, including studies of changes in the genital tract with reproductive aging. The Bronx WIHS has provided both operational excellence and scientific leadership nationally since WIHS's inception in 1993. In WIHS V we will continue to lead the WIHS-wide investigations in HPV and cervical neoplasia; cardiovascular disease and inflammation; genital tract mucosal immunology and virology; immunogenetics; HIV virology; musculoskeletal manifestations of HIV disease; and host characteristics influencing population based effectiveness of ART. We will also continue our excellent operational performance in providing high volume, complete, high quality data both for the WIHS core activities, and all substudies.          "

3 DP1 DA026182-05S1,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to grow rapidly, throughout the world. This is likely to remain so because i) HIV cannot be cured, ii) prevention is neglected and iii) a preventive vaccine remains elusive. In contrast, on the therapeutics front there has been tremendous progress. Since 1996, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has transformed AIDS into a chronic manageable illness. HAART stops HIV replication, therefore turning plasma viral levels to undetectable levels (<50 c/mL). This leads to a sustained immune recovery and near normal health. HAART has also been shown to decrease HIV levels in semen and vaginal secretions. As a result there has been growing interest regarding the possible role of HAART in directly preventing HIV transmission by decreasing infectiveness of those on treatment.  Supportive evidence for ""HAART as Prevention"" first emerged in vertical transmission studies where, ultimately, HIV transmission from the infected mother to her child has become exceedingly rare if HAART is in place. A possible effect of HAART on decreasing HIV transmission has been incidentally observed in HIV serodiscordant heterosexual couples and separately in population-level studies from Taiwan, San Francisco and in our own study in British Columbia, Canada.  We therefore propose to prospectively test the ""HAART as Prevention"" hypothesis, with a special focus on IDU. Specifically we propose to test that: 1) expanded HAART coverage among IDU will lead to a decrease in the number of new HIV infections within the population, including but not restricted to IDU; and 2) expanded HAART coverage among IDU, will lead to a decrease in adverse HIV/AIDS health outcomes among IDU. This proposal, named ""Seek and Treat for Optimal Outcomes and Prevention in HIV & AIDS in IDU"", represents both a groundbreaking and innovative research hypothesis with important consequences for the control of the global HIV epidemic."
3 K01 TW008410-03S1,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Mental disorders often co-occur with HIV/AIDS, yet continue to be left undiagnosed and untreated in Kenya.  These disorders are associated with poor medication adherence, risky sexual behavior, and ultimately the  continued spread of HIV/AIDS. Therefore, there is a critical need for effective assessment and treatment of  mental disorders such as major depression and alcohol use disorders particularly among people living with  or at risk for HIV/AIDS. Although major advances in the effective assessment and treatment of psychiatric  and alcohol use disorders have been made, these evidence-based methods are often not adapted and  tested in developing countries such as Kenya. The broad objective of this International Research Scientist  Development Award (IRSDA) is to promote evidence-based assessment and treatment of psychiatric and  alcohol use disorders through a translational approach that is both culturally appropriate and sustainable.  The specific aims of the research plan are to 1) Assess the prevalence of psychiatric and alcohol use  disorders among adults living with HIV/AIDS and adults being tested for HIV at a health clinic located in a  slum community of Nairobi, Kenya, and 2) Implement and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a  culturally relevant, sustainable, mental health referral and alcohol use disorder intervention program for  these adults. The candidate will conduct both qualitative and quantitative tests of the psychometric properties  of all assessment tools and intervention programs to be implemented. Supervised clinical psychology  Masters students will be used for this sustainable treatment model. The long-term objectives of this research  are to help build the capacity of primary care health clinics in underprivileged areas of Kenya such that they  are able to promote mental health care for all their patients and particularly the growing number with alcohol  use disorders. The candidate proposes to implement this research plan during a period of close mentored  training with experts in mental health assessment and treatment in both the United States and Kenya. The  proposed mentored training for the candidate will enable her transition towards independence as an  international mental health epidemiologist."
3 R01 DA010767-15S2,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The over-arching goals of the proposed research are (1) to examine the perceptions, beliefs, and use of novel tobacco products, including snus, dissolvables, e-cigarettes, little cigars, and hookah, among emerging adults (aged 20 - 26), and (2) to further the understanding of who is using or willing to use these products, and why they are using them. To accomplish these goals, we will add two assessments, 10 months apart, along with follow-up interviews with a portion of the participants, to our ongoing cohort-sequential longitudinal study (DA10767; Oregon Youth Substance Use Project; OYSUP). OYSUP, which is based on an epidemiological-based sampling strategy, has followed a representative sample of youth from one school district in Western Oregon annually across the previous 15 years, beginning when they were in the 1st through the 5th grade. To accomplish these goals we propose to conduct two questionnaire assessments with approximately 900 emerging adults, which will include measures of the awareness of each of these novel products, favorability of images associated with use, perceptions of risk (including health risks, relative risk compared to cigarette use, optimism bias, and risk of addiction), perceptions of benefits (i.e., motivations to use), assessment of personality, intentions and willingness to use each product, and quantity and frequency of use. This assessment will also include questions assessing current tobacco dependence and use of traditional tobacco products. We will conduct follow-up interviews with a portion of the participants (n = 300 at T1; n = 225 at T2). These will (a) include a time-line follow-back interview assessing order of use of products (including both novel and traditional) and circumstances of use, and (b) assess how participants learned about the product (communication channels, including social networking) and their exposure and receptivity to advertising messages, including point-of-sale messages. These assessments will allow for (a) the surveillance of these new products, including an assessment of awareness, use and willingness to use, how they learned about the product, and their beliefs and perceptions of risks and benefits; (b) the concurrent and prospective prediction of use from perceptions and beliefs; (c) the association of use of novel products with use of more traditional tobacco products (e.g., cigarettes and traditional ST, e.g., chew or snuff); and (d) the examination of unique and common predictors of tobacco use and use of these novel products.

3 R01 DA025537-05S1," PROJECT SUMMARY: Recent trends in U.S. urban centers indicate a rise in the number of new HIV infections in the population of young men who have sex with men (YMSM). These trends suggest a high level of vulnerability to HIV seroconversion in YMSM through sexual behavior as they emerge into adulthood. In addition, acts of sexual risk taking in this population often function synergistically with illicit drug use, and mental health burden. Despite some success with HIV prevention in the MSM population during the last 25 years, these recent patterns suggest that a reexamination of our prevention strategies for this population, especially for YMSM of color, is needed. Given the interplay that exists between unprotected sexual behavior, illicit drug use, and mental health burden, all such efforts must consider how these overlapping epidemics (also known as syndemics) fuel each other in a cohort of YMSM as they emerge into adulthood. Thus, we will we will initiate a prospective longitudinal program of research to follow the development of syndemics in a racially/ethnically and economically diverse cohort of urban HIV-negative YMSM in New York City as they transition from adolescence into young adulthood, and apply, test, and further develop a theory of syndemic production to understand the development of both maladaptive and adaptive behavioral outcomes. Specifically we seek to (1) develop and test theoretically informed measurement models of the covariance of illicit drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden among emergent adult HIV-negative YMSM within and across time, (2) assess whether patterns of behavior are continuous, discontinuous, or some combination of both; (3) delineate the risk and protective bases-physical factors (i.e., pubertal onset, HIV status), relational factors (i.e., family history of psychopathology, current romantic relationships, peer support, and characteristics of residential, social, and sex neighborhoods), and psychosocial factors (i.e., sexual identity, internalized homophobia, hypermasculinity, racial identity, racial devaluation, HIV optimism) that predict the development of syndemics, and (4) determine the extent to which the development of syndemics varies by race/ethnicity, social class, and homelessness/housing stability in a cohort of HIV-negative YMSM. Using multiple measurement modalities, which include biological assays, calendar based methods, and self-reports, we will follow the development of 675, 18-year-old HIV-negative YMSM. Participants will be recruited through venue-based and respondent driven sampling, as they emerge into adulthood, over seven waves of data collection within a 36-month time frame. We will utilize Structural Equation and Latent Growth Curve Analysis to answer our four main research questions."
3 R01 DA028692-04S1,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is growing recognition of the importance of 'place' on individual risk of disease, although most studies fail to capture the dynamic nature of the risk environment and its effect on the sex trade has been understudied. The Mexico/US border region is undergoing profound alterations in the environment in which sex work takes place, providing a 'natural experiment' through which we can explore the relative contributions of individual and structural factors on HIV transmission. The primary goals of this research are to define social, spatial, and physical factors affecting female sex workers (FSWs) in 2 border cities and determine their relevance to HIV epidemiology, drug use, and access to services. Tijuana and Ciudad (Cd.) Juarez have witnessed escalating community-level violence and, for Cd. Juarez, changes in the location and visibility of the 'red light' district. While migration and cross-border interactions are major influences, the recent global economic downturn is dramatically altering migration patterns. Based on the above, the specific aims of this project are to: 1) assess changes in social influences on the sex work risk environment over time in both cities and their effect on risk behaviors, HIV/STI incidence, and access to services; 2) determine the locations where FSWs live, work and engage in other activities and their relationship to risk behaviors, perceptions of violence, and access to services; and 3) determine the extent to which the built environment and other sex work venue characteristics relate to individual-level behaviors and HIV/STI incidence. To meet these aims, we will recruit 600 FSWs (300 per city) and collect sociodemographic, location, and behavioral data through interviews. All will be tested for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and Chlamydia and treated as needed. Follow-up interviews and testing will occur at months 6, 12, and 18. To meet aim 2, we will construct a geographic information system (GIS) of both cities and explore factors in relation to where FSWs live, work, buy/use drugs, and access services. Changing spatial relationships, such as the dispersal of the Cd. Juarez Zona Roja and intra-urban or cross-border mobility, will be analyzed to track patterns of infectious disease spread. We will also conduct in-depth interviews and an activity-travel survey with 30 sex workers per city, stratified by geography and venue (e.g. street, bar, etc.) to create geo-narratives based on time-geographic methods and computer-aided qualitative data analysis in order to explore the impact of recent social, economic, political, and other structural changes on participants' lives. To meet aim 3, field measurements of the built environment and other venue characteristics will be combined with individual-level data to explore their effect on health outcomes. The data collected will provide information vital to reframing HIV and drug use interventions to take into account the structural environment. This project is timely as HIV prevalence is rising along the U.S./Mexico border, presenting a window of opportunity to prevent transition to a generalized epidemic."
3 R01 DA029899-04S1,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this study is to explore the context of rising drug use along the Mexico/Guatemala border and define its relationship to the local epidemiology and phylo-geography of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Shifting drug trafficking routes, poor economic conditions, and increasing popularity of hard drugs among youth may be some of the factors driving substance use. Numerous regional and international migrants passing through the area likely contribute to the spread of HIV and STIs. However, data is lacking on the relationship between drug use and HIV/STIs in the region. Based on the above, the specific aims of this project are to: 1) describe the contextual factors affecting drug use and patterns of use in high risk populations along the Mexico/Guatemala border; 2) determine the prevalence and correlates of HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and STIs among substance users; and 3) explore the phylo-geography and molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 infection in at-risk groups. To meet Aim 1, 20 in-depth interviews with a diverse sample of substance users in Tapachula/Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico and 20 in the Teczn Uman/Quetzaltenango area of Guatemala will be conducted to provide contextual data on risk behaviors and help refine study instruments and methods. Additionally, focus groups with substance using men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSW), and migrants, as well as with organizations serving those at-risk for HIV will be conducted. To meet Aim 2, three consecutive cross-sectional cohorts (n=400, 200 on each side of the border) will be recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Face-to-face interviews will collect information on sociodemographics, HIV/STI knowledge, risk behaviors, and access to health services. All will be tested for HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex virus-2, and HCV, and treated as needed. Round 1 will comprise substance using FSWs; Round 2 will focus on the MSM population; and Round 3 will begin with peer recruiters (""seeds"") drawn from ""mobile"" persons- including truck drivers, deportees and regional and international migrants. We anticipate and will be able to measure the overlap between these risk groups. For Aim 3, we will sequence the HIV-1 pol gene, including reverse transcriptase, from those infected with HIV which will enable us to assess if recombinants or drug resistant strains of HIV-1 have emerged in this region and the extent to which there is mixing between at-risk groups. As migration routes have been identified as important corridors of disease transmission in other settings, they may be one of the first places new HIV subtypes will be identified. This project will create and expand ties among investigators in Mexico, Guatemala, and the U.S. and increase regional research capacity. Findings will help inform the development of subsequent HIV interventions and prevention programs that intervene upon risky substance use behaviors before they become further entrenched. Since the HIV epidemic in most of Latin America is still concentrated, there is a critical window of opportunity to prevent transition to a generalized epidemic. "
3 R01 DA030351-02S1,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fatal overdoses involving pharmaceutical opioids have increased dramatically over the past decade, surpassing those related to heroin, and are the leading cause of drug overdose in much of the U.S.  In Seattle- King County, 75% of drug overdoses involved pharmaceutical opioids and/or heroin in 2009. Opioid overdoses, heroin and pharmaceutical, are preventable and reversible. Recent research suggests that opioid users at risk for overdose have higher rates of HIV risk behaviors. The emergent group of heroin users who were initially dependent on pharmaceutical opioids (39% of heroin users according to a 2011 Seattle survey) has significantly lower HIV risk perceptions and HIV testing rates. Research indicates that drug users and their partners can be successfully trained to recognize and reverse overdoses with naloxone. Despite active heroin overdose prevention and intervention programs with naloxone (OOPIN) in 15 states with thousands of overdose reversals and no serious adverse events, rigorous studies of these programs on rates of subsequent heroin overdoses have not been conducted. No OOPIN programs or studies have yet been implemented for pharmaceutical opioid users at elevated risk for overdose. The Emergency Department (ED) setting holds great promise for identifying and recruiting those at elevated risk of heroin and pharmaceutical opioid overdose: 1) the ED study site for this proposal provides most services to those needing care for acute opioid related medical problems in Seattle, and 2) patients need for urgent medical attention may heighten their concern about potential harms from opioids. Unique to this setting is the potential to identify high risk pharmaceutical opioid users. ED interventions using brief behavior change counseling (BBCC) have been shown to significantly improve health behaviors such as alcohol use and injury, to increase entry into drug treatment as well as to reduce costs. Evidence is promising, but limited, regarding the impact of BBCC on opioid related risk behaviors. This prospective, randomized ED trial will study the effectiveness of an intervention that combines OOPIN with BBCC for both heroin users (n=500) and pharmaceutical opioid users at elevated risk for overdose (n=500). The primary outcome is subsequent opioid overdoses, ascertained by follow up interviews conducted at 3, 6 and 12 months as well as via administrative records for up to 24 months (i.e. medical records, ambulance responses, and death certificates). Hypotheses to be investigated include that the intervention recipients will have: 1) lower rates of opioid overdose, 2) reduced drug use and overdose risk behaviors, 3) more appropriate health care utilization, and 4) lower total health care costs. We will also determine the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors and the impact of the intervention on these behaviors. Excellent data systems and several features of clinical practice and policy make Seattle the ideal place to conduct this research. The study team is uniquely qualified to conduct this study and will be adapting interventions with which they have years of research and clinical experience.  "
3 R01 DA031074-03S1,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed 5-year epidemiologic study is to assess the impact of Mexico's new drug laws on behaviors and disease incidence among injection drug users (IDUs) in the U.S. In August, 2009, Mexico enacted a controversial law decriminalizing possession of personal-sized quantities of drugs including heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and cannabis. The sister-cities of San Diego, CA, USA and Tijuana, BC, Mexico share the world's busiest land border crossing and are home to nearly 4 million residents. Through research collaborations with the University of California, San Diego and partners in Tijuana, we found: i) increasing drug use and HIV prevalence in Tijuana; ii) dramatically higher prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and M. tuberculosis (Mtb) infections among IDUs in Tijuana versus San Diego; and, iii) injecting in Mexico reported by 21% of IDUs in San Diego. ""Drug tourism"" to Mexico among San Diegan IDUs may be an unintended consequence of Mexico's relaxed drug laws and could increase their risk for HCV, Mtb and HIV infections. This epidemiologic study aims to: 1) identify sociodemographic, behavioral, and health status differences between IDUs in San Diego who do and do not inject in Mexico; 2) describe changes in San Diegan IDUs' knowledge, attitudes, and experiences related to Mexican drug policies and assess their influences on decisions about injecting in Mexico; and 3) determine whether San Diegan IDUs who inject in Mexico are at increased risk for incident HCV and Mtb infection and identify risk factors for infection. To achieve these aims, we will use a mixed-methods design involving quantitative and qualitative data collection. Quantitative methods include recruiting a cohort of 750 IDUs in San Diego via respondent driven sampling for semi-annual behavioral assessments and serologic testing for HIV, HCV, and Mtb infections over 24 months of follow-up. HIV and HCV antibody testing will be performed on serum using standard practices; Mtb infection will be detected by QuantiFERON TB-Gold assay. Qualitative methods involve selecting 20 participants after each assessment visit (total=100) for in-depth interviews that will be used to: i) explore novel findings that emerge in preliminary analysis of the quantitative data; ii) identify new areas of inquiry for addition to the quantitative assessments; and iii) assess the validity of quantitative findings by presenting them for interpretation to study participants in qualitative interviews. The iterative process of using qualitative and quantitative data to inform methods and interpret findings of each approach facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the conceptual model describing how Mexico's new law will impact the behaviors and health outcomes of IDUs in San Diego. This study meets NIDA priorities supporting epidemiologic research on HIV/AIDS co-morbidities including HCV and tuberculosis, and the prevention of HIV among vulnerable populations. This study exploits a rare natural experiment to evaluate the impact of opposing drug policies on interconnected, bordering communities, and will provide important insights for future policies.

3 R01 DA031816-03S2,"With over 15 million past month users, marijuana is the most widely used illicit substance in the United States. This is concerning because marijuana use is associated with multiple outcomes such as accidents, aggression, risky sex that leads to HIV and school dropout. However, marijuana may also have some therapeutic effects and fourteen states have legalized medical marijuana. Colorado now has an estimated 100,000 medical marijuana patients, and this widespread use raises concerns about marijuana abuse, diversion and other consequences of use. Unfortunately, there are few data describing the impact of medical marijuana legalization. The Specific Aims and hypotheses of this proposed 5-year R01 study are: 1. During Phase I we will determine how the evolving medical marijuana industry operates from the perspective of consumers, MMC owners and prescribing physicians, as well as ascertain the views of drug treatment and health care providers concerning how medical marijuana impacts their responsibilities. As this Phase is designed to gather information to inform Phase III, there are no hypotheses. 2. In Phase II we will conduct an ongoing assessment of the epidemiology of medical marijuana, including change in the number of consumers and MMCs and consumers' and physicians' reasons for medical marijuana. Hypothesis 2: The increase in medical marijuana availability will lead to an increase in the prevalence of marijuana use and marijuana-related problems. 3. In Phase III we will assess the prevalence of marijuana abuse and dependence, diversion, other drug use, general health and health care utilization among medical and non-medical marijuana users. Hypothesis 3a: At baseline, there will be fewer medical marijuana users with cannabis dependence and they will have lower rates of other drug use and health problems than non-medical marijuana users. Hypothesis 3b: Over time, increase in rates of cannabis dependence, other drug use and health problems will be greater for medical marijuana users than non-medical marijuana users. Hypothesis 3c: Among medical marijuana users, there will be an increase in the diversion of medical marijuana over time. 4. Also in Phase III we will assess HIV-related sex risk behaviors among medical and non-medical marijuana users. Hypothesis 4a: At baseline, fewer medical marijuana users will report HIV sex-related risk behaviors than non-medical marijuana users. Hypothesis 4b: Over time, medical marijuana users will increase their engagement in HIV related sex-related risk behaviors more than non-medical marijuana users."
3 R03 DA033828-01S1,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Scope of Work Problem: South Africa, particularly the Western Cape, has experienced a dramatic rise in methamphetamine use over the past decade and also has the largest number of HIV-infected individuals (5.3 million) of any country in the world. It is feared that methamphetamine use may further fuel this HIV epidemic because of its association with risky sexual behaviors. Despite widespread concern about methamphetamine, there has been limited research examining the intersection of the methamphetamine and HIV epidemics in South Africa. Aims: The primary purpose of this exploratory study is to characterize the patterns and severity of drug use among methamphetamine users in Cape Town, and to identify the multiple levels of influence on HIV sexual risk behavior in this population (Aims 1 and 2). We will apply Ecological Systems Theory, which views behavior as reciprocally influenced by factors from the individual, social, environmental, and community levels, as an organizing framework for this research. A secondary purpose is to test the feasibility of using respondent driven sampling (RDS) to recruit methamphetamine users for future HIV prevention studies (Aim 3). Method: Following a phase of formative research to inform the recruitment strategy and pilot test the assessment battery, we will use a chain referral approach to enroll a convenience sample of 160 male and female methamphetamine users from a township in Cape Town for a multi-method study. All participants will complete a quantitative survey that assesses patterns of methamphetamine use and history of substance abuse treatment; rates of sexual risk behavior and use of HIV-related services; and correlates of sexual risk behavior at multiple levels of influence. A sub-sample of 30 participants will be selected for in-depth qualitative interviews to explore patterns of methamphetamine use, progression from casual use to addiction, and the social context of drug use; how methamphetamine use contributes to sexual risk behavior; and barriers and facilitators to drug cessation and treatment, safer sex practices, and HIV testing. Finally, we will test the feasibility of using RDS to enroll methamphetamine users in Cape Town into future HIV prevention research by conducting formative research to determine the suitability and acceptability of this recruitment method and to calibrate the method for this population, and by analyzing the chain referral data to determine whether RDS requirements are met. Significance: This timely proposal, among the first to target methamphetamine users in South Africa, will advance the field of HIV prevention by examining how methamphetamine use may contribute to HIV sexual risk behavior in a sample of non-injecting and primarily heterosexual drug users. The goal of the proposed research is to identify key factors that will inform the development of integrative prevention interventions to reduce methamphetamine use and sexual risk behaviors in the population.

3 R37 DA019829-08S1,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competing renewal proposes to evaluate the impact of recent Mexican drug policy reform on HIV-associated risk factors and protective factors among injection drug users (IDUs) in Tijuana, Mexico. In Aug/2009, Mexico approved a law that partially deregulates possession of small, specified amounts of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana for personal use. The law specifies that after this law is enacted in Aug/2010, police apprehending persons who possess sub-threshold amounts of any of these drugs will be released with a record noting that they received 'no penal action'; however, upon a third apprehension, they will be required to enter drug treatment, or go to jail. States are required to have completed drug treatment expansion by Aug/2012. The law has been met with praise and sharp criticism about potential unintended consequences. Our binational research team, which has conducted studies among IDUs in Tijuana for 6 years, proposes a longitudinal, mixed methods study to address the impact of Mexican drug policy reform on the following outcomes among IDUs in Tijuana: 1) Changes in knowledge, attitudes and experiences about the new law and their relationship to drug using behaviors and treatment readiness; 2) Temporal trends in drug use behaviors: i) frequency of injection, cessation and relapse; ii) possession and use of specific drugs and combinations; iii) involvement in gangs and drug economy; 3) Health risks and protective behaviors: i) injecting in shooting galleries and public spaces, ii) receptive needle sharing, iii) NEP and pharmacy attendance, iv) prevalence and incidence of overdose, HIV infection and death; 4) Experiences with drug treatment: i) proportion of drug users over time choosing treatment over incarceration; ii) incidence and experiences with voluntary and court-mandated drug treatment; 5) Law enforcement practices and interactions with IDUs: i) rates of arrest and incarceration; ii) perceived reasons vs. recorded reasons for arrest and incarceration; ii) experiences of cohort participants with police, including corruption and abuse. We will recruit a cohort of 750 HIV-negative IDUs through respondent driven sampling who will undergo semi- annual quantitative interviews and HIV tests. At each visit, a sub-sample who receive citations for drug possession-- especially those entering drug treatment involuntarily -- will be selected to undergo qualitative in- depth interviews to provide context on their knowledge of the law (Aim 1), experiences with drug treatment (Aim 4) and police (Aim 5). Administrative records from drug treatment programs, the police department and jails/prisons will be obtained to serve as independent outcome measures and assess city-level trends. Apart from Mexico, other Latin American countries and elsewhere are adopting more relaxed drug policy reforms. Given Mexico's important role in production and trafficking of illicit drugs, and Tijuana's location as a major corridor through which illicit drugs enter the U.S., this study represents an unprecedented natural experiment, allowing us to evaluate impacts of relaxed drug policy reforms on drug use, treatment, and HIV risk behaviors.

3 RC4 AI092552-01S2,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application, Interventions to decrease HIV infectiousness in Uganda, responds to the NIH Director's Opportunity for Research (RC-4) within the Global Health theme. Novel, cost-effective strategies are needed to efficiently deliver proven HIV prevention and treatment services in Africa to have a substantial impact on population HIV incidence. We posit that HIV transmission in a community can be reduced through targeted, population-level delivery of HIV prevention and care services to HIV+ persons, through increasing knowledge of HIV+ status with associated behavior change and reducing HIV infectiousness through initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and prevention and treatment of co-infections such as malaria. Home-based HIV counseling and testing programs, HBCT, have achieved large scale knowledge of HIV serostatus. We will build on the HBCT platform (""HBCT-plus"") with targeted diagnostic, preventive, and treatment services for HIV+ persons and behavioral counseling to reduce HIV infectiousness, which will augment our Methods of Prevention Program Project (MP-3) research in Uganda. We will implement HBCT-plus in 5000 households in a high HIV prevalence area in Uganda with point-of-care (POC) CD4 testing to triage HIV+ persons to ART following Uganda guidelines and prevention and treatment of co-infections for all HIV+ persons. We will deliver prevention-for-positives risk-reduction counseling and discordant couples counseling to reduce risk behaviors. We will conduct quarterly follow-up visits for one year to optimize uptake of clinical interventions and to assess risk behaviors and stigma. Measures of success of HBCT-plus will be impact on: 1) community viral load (average HIV plasma viral load in the community over 12 months), a marker of population-level HIV infectiousness, and 2) HIV transmission potential, a composite measure of viral load and sexual behavior among HIV+ persons with HIV- or unknown serostatus partners, who have the greatest impact on HIV spread. Specific Aims: 1) Demonstrate feasibility of HBCT-plus, with HIV testing, POC CD4 testing to triage HIV+ persons to care, and prevention-for-positives and discordant couples counseling, delivered to 5000 households in Uganda in one year, based on >90% uptake of testing and >80% linkage to care among HIV+ persons. 2) Measure the impact of HBCT-plus on HIV transmission risk in the community through assessment of community viral load and HIV transmission potential before and after HBCT- plus. 3) Measure disclosure to partners and family, HIV testing of partners, condom use, sexual frequency, and number of partners before and after positive prevention counseling for newly-identified HIV+ persons through HBCT-plus. 4) Evaluate the effect of HBCT-plus on community risk behaviors, attitudes about HIV testing, and stigma through a probability sample survey in the community. 5) Determine the incremental costs of HBCT and additional components in HBCT-plus for facilitated HIV care and counseling, and estimate the cost-benefit of community viral load reduction."

4 R01 AI084315-04,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to provide empirical data for the first time in India on the incidence of HIV and its determinants at the population level through a longitudinal study. This study will be conducted in a representative population-based sample of over 12,600 adult men and women from rural and urban parts of Guntur district in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh in whom we assessed baseline seroprevalence of HIV, herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) and syphilis, and the sexual and other risk behavior during 2004-2005. We will conduct a 5-year follow-up of this cohort to estimate new HIV, HSV-2 and syphilis infections and ascertain the determinants of HIV incidence and the transmission dynamics at the individual, partnership and broader levels. In addition, we will assess the bias in reporting sexual behavior using a confidential polling box approach for a more realistic understanding of risky sexual behavior at the population level. We will also assess effective coverage of and barriers to key HIV prevention, treatment and care interventions at the population level to understand how their coverage could be enhanced. Assuming a loss to follow-up of 25% of the baseline sample, based on a recent pilot study, we estimate that there will be 85 incident cases of HIV (95% confidence interval 63-107) at 5-year follow-up, which would be a reasonable number to explore the associations of new HIV infections with their determinants. We will utilize field procedures standardized in the baseline study that will be adapted for the follow-up study. Trained field staff will document socio- demographic background, sexual and other risk for acquiring HIV, and utilization of HIV interventions through interview and they will collect dried blood samples on filter paper using the finger prick method. Ethical considerations will be paramount to minimize risk to study participants. The laboratory analysis for HIV, HSV-2 and syphilis will follow a strategy similar to the baseline study, using internationally accepted test kits. Confidentiality of data will be ensured. Multivariate regression techniques will be used to assess the association of new HIV infections with determinants at the individual, partnership, cluster and geographic area levels. Our proposed study will provide original scientific data and analysis of new HIV infections and their determinants at the population level, bias in sexual behavior reporting, and barriers to HIV interventions. These unique and rigorous data will fill several key gaps in the evidence base needed for the understanding of HIV transmission and its control in high burden parts of India. "
4 R01 DA011591-13,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this competing renewal application is to evaluate the impact of evolving drug use patterns, as well as a range of social, structural, and environmental factors, on HIV incidence, morbidity, and mortality among a cohort of HIV-negative injection drug users (IDU) in Vancouver, Canada. We propose to undertake this work in a setting where a steady growth in methamphetamine injection has become an increasing concern. The proposed research involves the continuation of the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS), which is among the longest-standing cohort studies in North America. Since 1997, this study has led to more than 120 peer-reviewed publications in the area of public health, HIV/AIDS, and injection drug use. Vancouver, Canada, is unique in North America and is ideally suited to the proposed research questions for several reasons. First, the city is home to one of the most explosive HIV epidemics ever documented among IDU in the developed world, with HIV incidence peaking at 18 per 100 person-years in 1997 and persistently elevated HIV rates continuing up to 2007. Second, like many West Coast cities, Vancouver is in the midst of a massive growth in the use of methamphetamine and is also seeing a dramatic increase in methamphetamine injection. Third, Vancouver is unique in having an exceptionally large and visible street-based drug market and a large network of single-room occupancy hotels (SROs). We seek to build upon our past work focused on individual risk factors and health service use by investigating the impact of various social, structural, and environmental factors on HIV risk behavior, HIV incidence, morbidity, mortality, and hospital utilization among IDU. Herein we propose to continue our cohort-based approach involving semi-annual follow-up of 1000 HIV-negative IDU. We also propose to continue taking advantage of the universal healthcare system and centralized health data in British Columbia by linking participant data to a range of healthcare databases. Our proposed continuation of cohort-based research offers an ideal opportunity to examine the impact of evolving drug use patterns, as well as the impact of various social, structural, and environmental factors on the natural history of injection drug use. Given that methamphetamine use emerged on the West Coast, our investigation of rising methamphetamine injection could provide important information and early warning to other North American settings. In sum, through the continuation of VIDUS, we aim to address several urgent global health challenges and inform the development of a range of policies and interventions.    "
4 R01 DA021525-07,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this application is to seek renewed funding for a long-running prospective cohort of HIV- infected individuals who use injection drugs (IDU) linked to comprehensive HIV clinical monitoring to examine the impacts of individual, social, policy, economic, and physical exposures on HIV treatment outcomes. We seek to analyse the effects of these contextual determinants, including incarceration, homelessness, and involvement in the sex trade, on HIV RNA plasma viral load at both the individual and community levels. We will augment our ongoing epidemiologic and clinical research activities with molecular genetics and geographic information systems (GIS) based methods to model the effect of these exposures on community-level plasma viral load, HIV incidence, and the generation of antiretroviral drug resistance. In recognition of the increasing international attention to the HIV ""risk environment,"" a conceptual framework modeling the effect of exogenous and endogenous characteristics on the risk of HIV infection, we will employ this structure to integrate data from individual and community levels in analyses of HIV treatment outcomes. This proposal comes at a time of broad international consensus on the need to respond urgently to persistently elevated levels of HIV-related morbidity and mortality among IDU. Emerging evidence from mathematical modeling, observational cohorts and clinical trials has revealed the close link between the HIV RNA viral load within individuals and at the community level and the risk of HIV transmission between individuals, resulting in lower rates of infection in populations with higher levels of coverage of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART.) This observation has led to renewed HIV prevention efforts to seek out members of vulnerable populations, test them for HIV infection, and engage them in healthcare, including treatment for HIV infection, in order to reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality and lower the incidence of HIV seroconversion. Our proposed study will be conducted during a province-wide ""Seek, Test, and Treat"" campaign. Given the study infrastructure established to date and our track record evaluating barriers to HAART access and adherence, we are uniquely well placed to prospectively assess second-generation questions regarding the treatment as prevention campaign's impacts on community-level plasma viral loads, HAART resistance, and HIV incidence. In this regard, evaluations of treatment as prevention are an urgent priority in the FY 2012 Trans-NIH Plan for HIV-Related Research. In addition to the ""Seek, Test, and Treat"" campaign, our study setting of Vancouver, Canada, is ideally suited to our study aims. The universal healthcare system provides all medical care, including HAART, free of charge. Confidential record linkages allow the accurate attainment of all key measures, including health service utilization and HIV clinical outcomes. This application proposes a program of rigorous and innovative study that will marshal epidemiologic, geographic, and phylogenetic approaches to critically inform efforts to respond to HIV transmission and pathogenesis among IDU.

4 R01 DA028532-04,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this application is to evaluate the impacts of methamphetamine and a range of social, structural, and environmental factors on initiation into injection drug use, HIV risk behavior and sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence among street-involved youth. Globally, it is estimated that there are as many as 100 million street-involved youth, and illicit drug use and related harms (e.g., infectious diseases) have consistently been shown to be elevated among this population. Thus, there is an urgent need for data to inform interventions aimed at addressing the health needs of this growing population. In particular, given the challenges preventing harms (e.g., HIV infection) that occur after youth begin drug injecting, data to inform strategies to prevent initiation into injection drug use are urgently needed. We propose to undertake this work in a western Canadian setting where the explosive growth in methamphetamine use has mirrored a steady growth in the use of this drug in the western United States. While these trends are a source of growing concern due to methamphetamine's relationship with rising HIV risk behavior among men who have sex with men and adult IDU, the epidemiology of methamphetamine use and its relationship to sexual and injection-related HIV risk behavior remain poorly defined. Vancouver, Canada, is ideally suited for the proposed study for several reasons. First, the city is presently experiencing an explosive rise in the use of methamphetamine among street-involved youth, and past experience demonstrates that drug market trends in Vancouver are often reflected in other western US cities, and the city is known to be a North American port of entry for several illicit drugs and precursor chemicals which subsequently flow into the US. Thus, this research will provide valuable data to inform US drug trends and interventions. Vancouver is also home to a large and visible street-youth problem and street-based illicit drug market, and the risk environment in which street youth become involved in illicit drugs has not been well described. Herein, we propose to create an open prospective cohort study of 500 street-involved youth aged 14 to 25 who will complete a standardized questionnaire and provide biological specimens on a semi-annual basis. Given the local drug use and risk environment characteristics, as well as the local laboratory capacity, our proposed research plan offers an ideal opportunity to examine the impact of evolving drug use patterns and a range of social, structural, and environmental factors on the rates of initiation into injection drug use, sexual risk behavior and STI incidence. This research also presents a unique opportunity to create a cohort of street-involved non-injecting youth which will enable comparisons with an ongoing study of adult injection drug users. Together, this research will address several questions central to the urgent challenges facing street-involved youth in North America as a result of the growth of methamphetamine use and illicit drug injecting, and will allow for the evaluation of a range of individual and contextual determinants of HIV risk behavior and STI incidence among this population.

4 R01 DA028648-04,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this application is to use social epidemiological methods to prospectively evaluate the impact of social, environmental, and structural factors on partner-level sexual and drug risk patterns and HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence among FSWs and to assess the feasibility of a subsequent HIV/STI intervention targeting FSWs in public place-based settings (e.g. bars, streets). Despite growing evidence of the effectiveness of environmental-structural HIV/STI interventions targeting FSWs, this research has been largely derived from developing country settings and establishment-based venues, and there is limited prospective data on the social and structural context of HIV/STI risk among FSWs in North America. Given recent reports suggest a temporal shift from an injection to a sexually-driven HIV epidemic among street-involved populations in many North American settings, there is a crucial need for more prospective data on the contextual factors promoting and constraining partner-level sexual and drug risk patterns and HIV/STI acquisition. Vancouver, Canada is ideally suited for the proposed study for several reasons. First, due to the quasi-criminalized nature of sex work and large informal tolerance zones, we are in a unique position to evaluate the context of HIV/STI risk among FSWs, not currently feasible in most US cities. Second, unlike many urban environments where the FSW community is fragmented, the current social and legal context of sex work in Canada, our ability to harness strong community FSW support for this application, and new supportive housing models currently operating legally as quasi-brothels demonstrate significant innovation and strong potential for a subsequent intervention stemming from the results of this research. Herein we propose to create an open prospective cohort of 500 active FSWs working in public place-based settings, including interview administered questionnaires and HIV/STI screening at baseline and 6monthly follow-up over a five year period. To our knowledge this study is among the first prospective studies of public place-based sex work in North America and as such, we will be uniquely positioned to evaluate the risk environment and temporal trends in partner-level risks and HIV/STI acquisition among FSWs. This research will address several questions central to the urgent challenges facing HIV/STI prevention capacity in North America and will directly assess the feasibility of a subsequent intervention that will be of critical importance to other developed country settings.

4 R01 DA031055-03,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed study examines the effect of a recently initiated population-level biomedical intervention- expanded universal and free of cost highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-on HIV risk behaviors among a high-risk population, men who have sex with men (MSM), in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Of particular interest is whether the efficacy of expanded HAART access as an HIV prevention measure might be negated by socio-cultural/bio-behavioral factors, including risk compensation or ""HAART optimism"" within the MSM communities. The majority of new HIV infections in BC occur among MSM and this has remained largely unchanged since the year 2003 with approximately 200 new infections each year. The preventive value of HAART has been highlighted and the BC Ministry of Health has massively increased funding to expand access to HAART as a strategy to reduce the number of new HIV infections in the province. BC HIV treatment guidelines have also been relaxed so that HAART is available to almost all HIV-infected individuals in the province. Approximately 40% of persons who die from HIV-related causes in BC do not receive ART prior to death and approximately 27% of HIV-infected individuals may be unaware of their HIV status. This major expansion of access to HAART constitutes a population-level biomedical intervention-a rare, natural experiment-thereby creating an opportunity to examine the impact of expanded HAART access on complex determinants of HIV risk behaviors at the individual level.  Over the 5-year study period, we propose to use respondent driven sampling (RDS) to recruit a cohort of 270 HIV-positive and 410 HIV-negative MSM (680 in total) aged 16 years and older, and follow them up every 6 months for a median of four years. We propose to use RDS for its strength in recruiting deeply from hidden and diverse populations. Our main aims are to 1) examine trends in sexual risk behavior and attitudes regarding the preventive value of HAART over a 4.5-year period as the numbers of MSM on HAART dramatically increase and the concept of HAART as prevention becomes widely diffused; 2) examine how self-reported drug-use before and during sex explains HIV sexual risk behavior; and 3) examine the interactions between soft and hard drug use, HAART optimism and treatment adherence and continuation among HIV-positive MSM receiving HAART. All study participants will be asked to sign a consent form, complete a questionnaire using Computer Assisted Self-Interview technology, and undergo a rapid HIV test, syphilis test, hepatitis C serology, urine and anal swab screens for N. gonnorhea and Chlamydia trachomatis and to provide consent to allow researchers access to health services databases in the province. All HIV-positive individuals not already accessing regular HIV care will be linked to local healthcare providers for regular medical care and for assessment of need for HAART.      "
4 R01 DA033147-02,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this application is to apply a novel ethno-spatial approach to evaluate the impact of social, structural, and environmental factors on HIV risk behavior, HIV incidence, and HIV treatment outcomes among illicit drug users (DU) and female sex workers (FSW). As well, we seek to explore critical initiation and transition events that shape risk trajectories within these populations. Our proposed study is nested within a larger program of research that includes five NIDA-funded longitudinal cohort studies of adult DU and FSW and street-involved youth in Vancouver, Canada. Thus, our approach offers a 'value-added' opportunity to employ and integrate multiple data collection and analytic techniques to identify the impacts of social, structural and physical features of sex work and drug use scenes on HIV outcomes, and will include ethnographic observational fieldwork, in- depth interviews, geo-spatial mapping techniques, and quantitative laboratory and survey data. Through this effort we will seek to advance methodological approaches to the study of HIV/AIDS among vulnerable populations, by piloting a novel ethno-spatial approach to elucidate the complex pathways to HIV risk and HIV treatment among DU and FSW. Further, we aim to create a platform for the ongoing ethno-spatial evaluation of future interventions targeting DU and FSW that can be replicated in other settings within North America. The city of Vancouver is an ideal setting for the proposed research. Like many cities in the US, Vancouver is home to established drug and sex work scenes, and has experienced a high burden of HIV infection among DU and FSW. Officials in Vancouver, like those in several US municipalities, are implementing a range of policies and interventions aimed at reducing the public health and public order impacts of drug use and sex work, including those involving policing, supportive housing, and modifications to the physical environment. A nascent body of evidence suggests that while these interventions can reduce public disorder, they often have unintended negative consequences for vulnerable populations, prompting calls for an integration of public health and public order initiatives. However, the impact of such interventions on HIV risk behavior, HIV incidence, and HIV treatment outcomes has not been fully elucidated. Likewise, the associated impacts on critical initiation and transitional events among DU and FSW that shape risk trajectories are not well understood. Globally, there is growing recognition of the need to identif how social, structural and physical environments affect the health of marginalized drug using populations, and how interventions can address these levels of influence. The evaluation of social and structural influences and the promotion of methodological diversity have been identified as high priorities within the Office of AIDS Research's Trans-NIH Plan for 2011. Accordingly, through the use of complementary and innovative mixed-methods research, we aim to address several urgent health challenges, which will inform the development of a range of policies and interventions in both Canada and the United States.

4 R24 TW008889-04,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Nairobi (UON) has formed the Partnership for Innovative Medical Education (PRIME) in collaboration with two of its longstanding training partners, the University of Washington (UW) and the University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB). The primary goal of the PRIME application is to strengthen and build clinical and research capacity in the UON School of Medicine for HIV and HIV-related conditions. Because the UON trains more than half of all Kenyan doctors entering the workforce each year, a program improving the quality of medical education (Aim 1), extending the reach of medical training outside Nairobi (Aim 2), and increasing retention of UON faculty (Aim 3) has potential to have a major impact on improving human resource capacity for health and health outcomes long-term in Kenya. To improve the quality of medical education at UON, we propose a combination of strategies, including the use of an innovative ""skills lab"" that will allow students to have hands-on clinical experiences using expert patients and simulation models. In addition, faculty will be trained in clinical teaching using HIV as a platform, and new educational approaches will be rigorously evaluated to allow promotion of the most effective methods university-wide. To extend the reach of the clinical training described above, PRIME will develop and implement a decentralized, community-based program that optimizes training in primary care and preventive medicine around HIV/AIDS. This will be done by training and accrediting local medical doctors and specialists at 12 district hospitals outside Nairobi which will become rotation sites for medical students, interns, and postgraduates. Distance learning and mobile phone applications will also be introduced for training and care at these decentralized sites to ensure sustainability of training over time. In the third aim, PRIME will promote faculty development by providing opportunities for UON postgraduates and faculty to pursue clinical or applied research. This will be accomplished through three different mechanisms: 1) a one-year mentored fellowship in implementation science, 2) a career development award in clinical research, and 3) a seed grant program. Together, these strategies will result in creation of an enabling academic environment which will encourage locally driven research and a sustainable increase in the recruitment and retention of academic faculty.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application builds on the strengths of three partnering universities (UON, UW and UMB) to address the current medical education challenges faced by UON, with the ultimate goal of improving healthcare delivery across Kenya. As UON is the largest medical school in Kenya and one of the largest in East Africa, improving quality of training around HIV and related conditions at the institutional level and extending this into communities could have a profound effect on HIV-specific and overall health outcomes.

4 R37 AI050529-12,"Zoonofic infecfions rennain an important threat to human health. In this merit extension, we will confinue to  identify primate reservoirs of human disease, elucidate mechanisms of pathogen cross-species transmission  and examine why zoonofic infecfions are frequently associated with severe illness. Specifically, we propose:  1. To identify the ape reservoirs of HIV-1 groups O and P. While the origins of H|V-1 groups M and N  have been traced to distinct chimpanzee communities in southern Cameroon, the precursors of HIV-1  groups O and P are still uncertain. This is because SIVcpz/SIVgor strains closely related to these lineages  have not yet been identified. Large numbers of chimpanzees and gorillas in west central Africa have not yet  been screened for SIV. We will thus conduct molecular epidemiological studies in these areas, determining  the prevalence, distribution and genetic diversity of SIVcpz/SIVgor infections. We expect these studies to  identify the geographic and species origins of HIV-1 groups O and P.  2. To determine the natural history of SIVgor infection. We recently identified one area in southwestern  Cameroon that represents a hotspot of SIVgor infection (25% prevalence). Prospective studies of three  gorilla groups at this site identified 29 SIVgor positive individuals, including two who only recently became  infected. We will continue to follow these groups prospectively, tracking both infected and uninfected  individuals, characterizing their viruses, and determining the impact of SIVgor infection on their population  size. This will allow us to determine whether SIVgor, like HIV-1 and SIVcpz, is pathogenic in its natural host.  3. To determine whether wild apes serve as a recurrent source for human infection. The recent  discovery of HIV-1 group P strongly suggests that cross-species transmissions of ape SIVs are still ongoing.  Using newly developed diagnostic assays, we will test humans who live in close proximity to wild apes for  SIV zoonoses, focusing on populations with known exposure to primates. We will also screen humans for  ape Plasmodium parasites, having recently discovered the origin of human P. falciparum in gorillas. The goal  is to determine whether and to what extent wild apes represent a recurrent source of human pathogens.  4. To identify viral determinants of cross-species transmission and human adaptation. Host specific  restriction factors, in particular tetherin, pose major hurdles to SIV cross-species transmission. However, 12  independent HIV-1 and HIV-2 introductions indicate that these hurdles are not insurmountable. We will  continue to evaluate tetherin and other restriction factors as barriers to cross-species transmission and  secondary spread. In particular, we will examine whether the lack of an effective tetherin antagonism  contributed to the inability of the rare groups of HIV-1 and HIV-2 to spread epidemically, and whether the  apparent absence of SIVcpzPfe infections in humans can be explained by a similar mechanism."
4 R37 AI051231-12,"Heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 remains the dominant mechanism by which the epidemic is sustained  woridwide. In a majority of transmissions, infection is established by a single genetic variant (the transmitted  founder, TF) from the quasispecies of the transmitting partner (TP), with evidence for reduced Env  glycosylation relative to their chronic counterparts. This concept of selection of virus with traits that favor  transmission has been supported by our recent studies of viruses in the genital tract (GT), but it remains to  be determined what functional properties differentiate TF viruses from their transmitting partner counterparts  We hypothesize that differences in TF virus proteins allow preferential infection of key cell types within the  genital mucosa and through interactions with antigen presenting cells signal the influx of activated CD4 T  cells that can home to gut tissues. In this context, we will generate and characterize full-length single HIV-1  TF virus genomes and genomes amplified from TP bloodand GT in 20 Rwandan and Zambian transmission  pairs; determine their abilities to productively infect vaginal and cervical tissue explants, determine whether  different cells are infected by donor and recipient viruses, investigate their ability to interact with alpha-4,  beta-7 molecules on mucosal T-cells and to induce the release of cytokines in antigen presenting cells  capable of signaling trafficking of relevant activated T-cell populations.  Newly infected partners in couples infected by different strains of HIV-1, are at high risk for superinfection  and subsequent virus recombination. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that susceptibility to  superinfection is related to low levels of neutralizing antibodies immediately prior to superinfection and that  studies of superinfection will inform on the nature of protection required for an effective vaccine. We will  therefore determine the frequency, kinetics and the virologic/immunologic ramifications of HIV superinfection  in this cohort, as well as determine whether specific immunologic defects, such as low levels of protective  antibody contribute to susceptibility to superinfection. The results of these studies will yield novel information  that is critical to the design and testing of globally effective vaccine candidates."
4 U01 AI069924-08,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Background: This proposal asks for continued support of leDEA-SA, a large collaborative network of HIV care and antiretroviral treatment (ART) programs in Southern Africa. Aims: (i) to provide the best available data on long-term program effectiveness in children, adolescents and adults; (ii) to describe long-term regimen durability and tolerability and examine different monitoring and treatment strategies, with a focus on viral load and second-line ART; (iii) to describe co-morbidities, focusing on tuberculosis and cancer and (iv) to follow up pregnant women on ART and cohorts of ART-exposed non HIV-infected infants and infected infants, and (v) to build capacity in the region. Methods: 20 urban and rural ART programs from 7 countries (Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Republic of South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe) with follow-up up to 10 years will pool data to create a database of 400,000 HIV-infected adults, 10,000 adolescents, 36,000 children and 6,700 infants, with about 70% of patients on ART. In South Africa, HIV data will be linked to the National Cancer Registry, National Death and Birth Registers, and the Tuberculosis Register. Mortality, loss to follow-up, tuberculosis and recurrent tuberculosis, and AIDS-defining and other cancers will be analyzed, as well as fertility, CD4 cell trajectories, treatment-limiting toxicities, response to second-line ART and resistance mutations in adults and children failing ART. Trends in exposure to antenatal and postnatal ARVs, pregnancy outcomes including prematurity and anthropometry, feeding practices and growth over 18 months will be examined in sub- cohorts of pregnant women and infants. We will survey the provision of care to cancer patients, and compare different screening strategies for invasive cervical cancer. Statistical analyses will consider the hierarchical nature of the data, missing data and loss to follow-up, competing risks and time-dependent confounding, and new methods will be developed. Accumulating results will be used to build and parameterize a mathematical model of ART in children, adolescents and adults, which will reflect the realities of HIV care and ART in Southern Africa, and inform health policy.       RELEVANCE:    Southern Africa is the region most heavily affected by the HIV epidemic. Since 2004, efforts by governments and others have resulted in a massive increase in HIV/AIDS interventions and particularly ART. Operational, clinical and public health research is urgently needed to guide the long-term delivery of HIV care and ART to the many patients in need, including pregnant women, infants, children and adolescents.

4 U2R TW006879-10,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the training program is to conduct training, research and mentorship as well as operationalize research findings in order to strengthen the national capacity to address the public health and scientific challenges of the evolving HIV and TB epidemic in Uganda. This goal will be achieved through collaboration between Joint Clinical Research Centre, Makerere, Gulu and Mbarara Universities of Uganda, Uganda National TB and Leprosy Program, Uganda Ministry of Health, Case Western Reserve University USA and University of Georgia USA. The specific training objectives of this proposal are to strengthen the research training capacity and infrastructure for clinical, operational, and health services research on HIV/TB infections through training, mentorship and strengthen collaboration between HIV and TB control programs as well as collaboration between these programs and academic/research institutions with the view of promoting HIV/TB co-infection prevention, care and treatment. To achieve objectives, we propose inter-disciplinary training in post-graduate degree (long term) and non- degree courses (short-term and intermediate term) courses in Uganda as well as in US institutions. The long term degree raining will be in specialties relevant to HIV/TB prevention and management (such as epidemiology, health services research, public health and clinical specialties). The short-term and medium- term courses will include health informatics, bioethics, operations research, clinical trials, and dissemination and implementation research. Though we will continue with the mix of training experiences in Uganda and US, we propose to have more training at Masters degree in Uganda. This will create a greater demand for mentors for the trainees, so we propose to have training in mentorship for senior researchers who will become mentors of the trainees. The mentors' manual that was developed in the first five years of COHRE phase II will be mad widely available to potential mentors and mentees."
4 U2R TW006896-10,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of GHESKIO-Cornell ICOHRTA training program is to increase capacity in integrated clinical, operational, and health services research in support of Haiti's national scale-up of HIV and tuberculosis services. Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and has the highest rates of both HIV infection and tuberculosis. It is estimated that 3% of the adult population isHIV- infected and that the prevalence of tuberculosis is 402/100,000 population (100xUS rates). In response to this epidemic, the Haitian Ministry of Health asked GHESKIO to form a national HIV and TB Network, a collaboration of 32 public and private health care organizations across the country that is charged with ""scaling-up"" to provide a standardized package of HIV and tuberculosis services to 500,000 persons by 2014. The services include voluntary counseling and HIV testing, management of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections, prevention of mother to child HIV transmission, and comprehensive HIV care of children, adolescents, and adults. The Haitian Ministry of Health has asked GHESKIO (Haitian Study Group for the Study of Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections) to lead this network through training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation, and through the conduct of operational and health services research. GHESKIO is an international research and training institution that has benefited from 25 years of uninterrupted NIH funding and research capacity building with Cornell University, and support from the Fogarty International Center. GHESKIO is recognized as a center of research excellence, and is a member of the NIH HIV Vaccine Trials Network (VTN), the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) and a recipient of support from the United Nations Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS relief (PEPFAR). In the current proposal, GHESKIO will continue as the primary training institution and extend research capacity to other organizations in Haiti that are participating in the GHESKIO HIV and Tuberculosis Network. The program will continue to emphasize medium- and long-term training in Haiti. Since its inception four years ago the ICOHRTA has provided training to 120 Haitian biomedical personnel, all of whom are working in Haiti, providing HIV/TB services and conducting operational and health services research. GHESKIO, in collaboration with Haitian and International partners, will develop training curricula in clinical, operational, and health services research methodology and in ethics, program management, and scientific writing. A Masters in Public Health Degree program, established with ICOHRTA support, will continue to be offered in Haiti by Quisqueya University, in partnership with GHESKIO and Cornell University."
4 U2R TW006918-10,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of the Multidisciplinary HIV and TB Implementation Sciences Training in China (China ICOHRTA2) are to build on the existing China ICOHRTA to further strengthen the capacity of the Chinese Center for Disease Control (CCDC) to conduct training in implementation science and to facilitate its establishment as a regional leader in research and training for HIV and TB prevention, care and treatment. The RTU administering China ICOHRTA comprises CCDC, UCLA and Yale University. China ICOHRTA2 will achieve these goals by designing and implementing a training program to close critical gaps in research and implementation sciences skills and knowledge, and achieve maximum long-term impact through further developing and expanding a cadre of highly trained research scientists. China ICOHRTA2 will have degree and non-degree components of varying duration available to different types of HIV and TB scientists and health professionals.

4 U2R TW008258-05,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tanzania is one of the most affected countries in sub-Saharan Africa by HIV/AIDS and TB. We propose to train future leaders to conduct research in epidemiological, operations and health services, and clinical research of HIV/AIDS and TB in Tanzania. Based on an in-depth needs assessment we identified training gaps in three principle areas: (1) research methods including quantitative, qualitative, and cost-effectiveness research methods; (2) substantive knowledge of prevention, care and treatment of HIV/AID S and TB; and (3) Research Systems Strengthening that include training on bioethics, grant writing, and manuscript development. This training initiative will be undertaken by Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences and Harvard School of Public Health, in partnership with the National Institute of Medical Research, Ifakara Health Institute, the Ministry of Health, and the Tanzania Commission for AIDS. Over more than a decade, we have developed a multidisciplinary team of investigators that advanced research training related to discovery of knowledge including the safety and efficacy of various interventions. Over the next 5 years we propose to focus on building capacity in the area of clinical, operational, and health systems research that would advance the implementation of evidence-based best practices on HIV/AIDS and TB. Training will be provided in Boston and Dar es Salaam, with the latter assuming greater proportion of the training activities over the five years of the program. Trainees will benefit from exposure to a broad range of existing collaborative projects between the proposed partners including epidemiological and laboratory studies, randomized clinical trials, operations research programs, and existing datasets. These resources will provide unique opportunities for research training, including practical aspects of study design and implementation and refinement of skills in data analysis and manuscript development. We will regularly monitor our performance and strive to develop a system for sustainable training activities in Tanzania."
5 D43 TW000231-19,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed training program builds on the successes and lessons of the previous 14 years to meet the new emerging and evolving challenges of a maturing HIV epidemic in southern Africa, the epicenter of the global HIV pandemic. The 125 long-term and 186 short-term trainees of the current program continue to have a major impact through their leadership roles globally and locally, as their research generates new knowledge in areas such as HIV pathogenesis in acute HIV infection, new prevention technologies (including antiretrovirals to prevent breastfeeding transmission, vector-based HIV vaccines and antiretroviral microbicides), and new approaches to treating HIV-TB co-infection. The trainees have published 894 peer- reviewed papers including several in high impact journals like Science, Nature and the Lancet.  The emergence of HIV-associated drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), the implementation of the largest AIDS treatment program in the world and the dire need for evidence to guide decision-making as South Africa transitions from its denialist past to a politically enlightened future under a new Minister of Health, have created a set of new challenges and opportunities for the next cycle of this program. Building on the substantive science base, extensive research infrastructure and local expertise created through this program, the rich tapestry of in-country AIDS and TB studies, the strategic collaborations within and outside South Africa, and the new opportunities to leverage funding from other agencies, the proposed program will continue to identify trainees with the most potential, offer them high quality training both in South Africa and the USA and provide them with ongoing support to create a critical mass for an effective response to the HIV and TB epidemics in southern Africa. The proposed program sets about this task well armed with the most valuable lessons learnt in the past decade such as the importance of long-term in-country mentorship, ongoing training in grant writing and administration, strategic partnering to maximize training opportunities, recruitment of candidates in consultation with local productive research groups and the value of having joint USA and South African faculty in raising the standard of in-country training.  Guided by the ongoing assessment of training priorities and with careful oversight from a balanced US- SA Training Advisory Committee, that includes several previous trainees who are now senior investigators, we will continue to provide, as appropriate, a variety of short-to-medium, and long-term training opportunities in the USA, South Africa, Swaziland, Namibia and Lesotho. The emphasis of the program in the next cycle is to i) address critical training gaps in existing HIV and TB centers of research excellence in South Africa to meet the new emerging challenges in the HIV epidemic, ii) provide support and mentorship for young investigators, especially medical students, and iii) provide the training critical to the efforts of South African AIDS research to transition from the current reliance on multicenter studies to a more sustainable balanced portfolio with increased levels of investigator-initiated research. The goal is to strengthen and expand the existing number of independent HIV and TB research teams in southem Africa; strengthen local capacity to assume more of the region's training needs and developing the skills needed to assist policy makers with evidence to implement and monitor the scale-up of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment programs.

5 D43 TW000233-19,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SUNY Downstate Medical Center (SUNY-DMC) proposes to renew its current AITRP by continuing to focus on the rapidly expanding injection drug use mediated HIV epidemic in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The NYS International Training and Research Program (NYS-ITRP) was initiated as a Fogarty funded AIDS International Training and Research Program (AITRP) in 1993 to focus on Central Europe. It has since expanded to include 3 Baltic States: Armenia, Georgia, and Russia. This program represents a unique merging of an academic medical center, a school of public health and a state department of health, which combined with other training assets in New York State, allows us to respond to the continuing challenges of preventing new infections in the region. During the past 16 years, the combined AITRP has provided support for 76 long-term trainees, 3 of whom are still in training. They have been remarkably productive publishing over 650 articles and providing strong academic and public health leadership regionally and internationally. With this application we propose to expand our activities to Kazakhstan and Ukraine two countries with large IDU driven epidemics where we have identified strong local partners. We will continue to provide ongoing training to Russia, Georgia and Estonia and expand our training programs to include nurse training as well as enhance the development of regional public health training. The program's aims are: a. To build human resources capacity in our collaborating countries by providing long-term training in the US and ultimately in-country in population-based, biomedical and implementation research; b. To foster collaborative, interdisciplinary in-country research networks among our trainees and those supported by other programs; c. To utilize academic resources in New York State as well as the Fogarty network to ensure that the most productive assets are utilized for training efforts; d. To build in-country research capacity and productivity via a continuous mentoring process; e. To assist in the transition of in-country assets Into regional centers of excellence. In meeting its aims the NYS-ITRP's overall goal is to train a new generation of investigators capable of working in multidisciplinary environments capable of producing the research necessary to guide national priorities for successful treatment, prevention and care."
5 D43 TW001028-13,"ABSTRACT  During the past decade we have concentrated our efforts in St. Petersburg, Russia  training young behavioral and medical scientists to participate in interdisciplinary HIV  epidemiological, behavioral, and prevention research. Our most successful trainees -  those who have made significant contributions to past and ongoing research  collaborations - have been university-affiliated junior faculty members who conduct  their research in either non-governmental organizations, research institutes, or branches  of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Building on these successes, we will continue to  provide interdisciplinary mentored research training to build cadres of research  competence at these institutions and simultaneously develop the necessary  interdisciplinary collaborations to succeed in building research teams to conduct  epidemiological, behavioral, and prevention research in St. Petersburg and more  broadly in the Russian Federation. We have identified five focus areas for research  training: primary prevention for high-risk populations, secondary HIV prevention for  HIV positives, health services research, nursing research, and translational research.  This application will describe the successes and challenges of our current training  program, highlight the research conducted by trainees in collaboration with their Yale  mentors, and detail the new directions we will take to continue to produce well-trained,  motivated, and successful researchers who possess the interdisciplinary competencies  to succeed as research scientists and make productive contributions in responding to  the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Russia, which remains one of the fastest growing in the  world."
5 D43 TW001035-15,"The Vanderbilt University (VU) Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ) AITRP, formerly the VU-University of Alabama at Birmingham AITRP, seeks renewal of its grant, now in its tenth year due to an NIH-initiated one-year extension. We contribute research training to both institutional and individual biomedical and behavioral research capacities focused on HIV-related research in both prevention and care. The VU-CIDRZ training partnership with our international collaborators is designed to train foreign scientists and key research support staff to conduct independent research and training in their home countries, as well as perform at an internationally credible level in collaborations with local and foreign scientists. We now seek to renew our AITRP with a continued focus on Zambia (since 1998), Pakistan (since 1994), India (since 2000), China (since 2000), and our newest partnership in Mozambique (VU training partnership since 2006 and developmental AITRP engagement since 2007). We have completed our older training commitments in Mongolia, Jamaica, and Russia and will complete our training commitments for Bangladesh upon the graduation of a current doctoral training (anticipated in 2011). We have restricted our AITRP training partnerships to five focus cities in order not to dilute our impact to where we have funded overseas research and strong research training partners. At the same time, we have leveraged support in each of the five venues such that our AITRP resources will go much further than permitted by the grant's funding alone. We will continue to provide a diverse portfolio of long, medium, and short-term training options. To date 58 trainees have received graduate degrees, 97% of whom have returned to work in their home countries, 8 are currently in degree programs and over 2,000 have been trained through our in-country advanced short- courses. We believe VU remains an ideal university partner for this initiative for several significant reasons The migration of the training program to VU offers the opportunity for trainees to receive the absolute highest quality of graduate training and exposure to innovative HIV/AIDS/STD/TB related research, resources, and faculty mentors. The program is uniquely positioned within the infrastructure of the VU Institute for Global Health (VU IGH),directed by Dr. Vermund with its ""center-without-walls"" philosophy that nurtures noncompetitive partnerships among and within VU and with partner institutions around the globe. We feel that the innovative features of our renewal and our proven track record address the unmet needs in international AIDS training.  RELEVANCE (Seeinstructions): The VU-CIDRZ training partnership with our international collaborators is designed to strengthen both institutional and individual biomedical and behavioral research capacities focused on HIV-related research in both prevention and care in developing countries.

5 D43 TW001039-15,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the second competitive renewal application for the UNC AIDS International Training and Research Program. We propose to continue to provide training in three countries: The Peoples Republic of China, Malawi and Cameroon. Investigators at UNC have worked in China since 1979, Malawi since 1989, and Cameroon since 1998. The UNC AITRP has embraced several guiding principles. First, we use training to build strong ties to key in-country organizations. Trainees with guaranteed ""return jobs"" in these organizations are preferentially selected. Second, our training opportunities build on funded research projects and bridge many of the strengths of UNC. Wherever possible we combine basic, clinical and epidemiological training and research in order to build critical mass. Third, we have used the Fogarty training to promote international research, working with many collaborators and funding agencies. Fourth, we have developed south-to-south and international collaborations to facilitate training and ongoing research opportunities. For example, University of the Witwatersrand is a training site for Malawi personnel, and we have developed a strong collaboration with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine for training of physicians from Malawi (a former British protectorate). Fifth, we have looked for opportunities for evolution and innovation. Such efforts have been particularly important in the development of a new Department of Public Health at the Malawi College of Medicine (which has received dedicated Fogarty support), extensive research ethics and IRB training in China, and rapid technology transfer in all three UNC AITRP countries. Sixth, we are committed to in- country leadership and ongoing mentorship after the trainee has completed our program. "

5 D43 TW008633-04,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a new AIDS International Training Research Program (AITRP) to build sustainable research capacity on primary and secondary prevention of HIV, TB and STIs in the Mexico-US border region, which is experiencing a serious, emerging HIV epidemic. The primary institutional partners will be the two largest public universities in this region: the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and the Universidad Autonoma de Baja California (UABC), in Tijuana. We will also engage other academic partners on both sides of the border: the Graduate School of Public Health at San Diego State University (SDSU), El Colegio de la Frontera Norte (COLEF), Xochicaico University and the Institute Nacional de Salud Publica (INSP). Despite extensive binational collaborations, our existing training programs are restricted to U.S. citizens. Across the border region, there is a dearth of researchers who have formal public health training. Our aims are: 1) To develop sustainable regional research capacity to support training in prevention of HIV, TB and STIs in the Mexico-US border region; 2) To promote graduate education at UABC by supporting Masters and PhD level training in Public Health and a culture of mentoring developing scientists; 3) To advance knowledge in the prevention of HIV, TB and STIs through binational mentored research projects that will support evidence- based translation of research into policy and practice. To meet these aims, we propose a coherent, multi- disciplinary program of education and training in degree and non-degree experiences, based both in San Diego and Tijuana, which are located less than one hour apart. The mainstay of the degree training will consist of MPH and PhD level training at UABC, with the opportunity for electives offered at UCSD and SDSU, and virtual lectures offered through UCSD, UABC, COLEF and INSP. Non-degree training will include short and long term training experiences offered in the U.S. and Mexico. Given rapid increases in HIV prevalence and incidence documented recently among high risk populations in the Mexico-US border region, our AITRP is poised to leverage existing research and training programs to increase the capacity of Mexican researchers to respond to an emerging HIV epidemic that could soon become generalized.

5 DP1 AI106275-03,"   DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   The global AIDS pandemic continues to expand despite significant advances in understanding HIV-1 pathogenesis and the development of powerful antiviral drugs. HIV-1 is transmitted primarily through sexual contact and more than 30 million people are currently infected worldwide. In some regions of the world such as southern Africa the prevalence of HIV-1 infection exceeds 20%. The devastating spread of HIV-1 in young women in these countries appears out of proportion to the overall risk of infection. Thus it is possible that a biological co-factor contributes to virus spread. The hypothesis of this proposal is that acquisition by HIV- 1 of the envelope glycoprotein of gammaretroviruses (murine leukemia virus-related viruses) in a process we call """"natural pseudotyping"""" expands the cellular tropism of HIV-1 enabling it to directly infect vaginal epithelial cells thereby dramatically increasing the risk of infection during sexual intercourse. We propose a molecular epidemiology study consisting of four major aims. 1) To complete in vitro studies of gammaretrovirus/HIV-1 pseudotyping; 2) To demonstrate gammaretrovirus/HIV-1 co-infections in local donors; 3) To demonstrate the effect of gammaretrovirus pseudotyping on vaginal transmission in an animal model; 4) To determine the prevalence of gammaretrovirus infection and HIV-1 co-infection in southern Africa. Natural pseudotyping of HIV-1 is predicted to occur in individuals co-infected with HIV-1 and a gammaretrovirus (XMRV/MLV) since the cellular tropism of these two viruses overlap to include T cells. The formation of XMRV-pseudoptyped HIV-1 (HIV-1/gp70) (now with the cell tropism of XMRV) in blood or lymphoid tissue would result in HIV-1 infection of normally resistant cells in the urogenital tract. Prior or subsequent infection of these cells with XMRV would result in the release of HIV-1/gp70 into seminal fluid or vaginal secretions. The potential implications of natural pseudotyping of HIV-1 are profound.      "
5 DP1 DA034978-02,"The goal of this project is to integrate data from local research, clinical and public health entities that are screening for and treating HIV infected persons. These data will be obtained in a de- identified manner, parsed and then organized into a HIPAA compliant database containing socio- demographic, geographic, reported risk behaviors and viral sequence information. The database will update itself in real-time as new HIV infections are identified, and viral sequence data will be used to map out the phylogenetic network of our local epidemic, focusing on drug using risk groups. We will utilize a background of nationwide HIV sequences obtained from publically available repositories to improve the signal in our phylogenetic structures and use Bayesian maximum likelihood analysis to build these networks in a robust manner. Finally, we will use this system to map the socio-demographic, geographic, risk behavior and phylogenetic data to locations of newly identified acute and early HIV infections. In real-time, these results will be used to identify micro-communities and sub-networks with HIV transmission associated with injection drugs or methamphetamine use, and we will use this information to direct community specific prevention resources (i.e. needle exchange, HIV testing, education, etc.) with the ultimate goal of preventing HIV transmission clusters from developing or expanding, particularly among substance using communities. Specific Aims"
5 DP1 DA034989-02,"Half or more of HIV transmission events may occur within the period of high infectivity (and  often high risk behavior) that can last 11 months or more after a person is initially infected.  Unfortunately, neither test-and-treat intervention methods nor Acute HIV Infection projects have  found effective ways to intervene against transmission during this risky ""recent infection"" period.   We seek to develop effective intervention techniques against HIV transmission among drug  users and their community members during the recent infection period using a combination of  drug injection-, sexual- and social-network-based contact tracing methods; community alerts in  the networks and venues of recent infectees; and the logic of going ""up"" and ""down"" infection  chains. Our first Aim is to develop and evaluate ways to locate ""seeds,"" defined as drug users  and other people who have recently been infected. Our second Aim targets members of seeds'  networks and people who attend their venues. We will test them for acute and for recent  infection, and alert them to the probability that their networks contain highly-infectious members  so they should reduce their risk and transmission behaviors for the next several months to  minimize their chances of getting infected. This may also reduce transmission by untested  people with recent infection. Community, network and venue education about the need and  value of supporting those with recent infection should reduce stigma. Our third Aim is to reduce  HIV transmission and to develop new ways to evaluate ""prevention for positives"" generally as  well as our own success in reducing transmission. We will do this using a combination of follow-  up interviews and testing, including of viral loads; phylogenetic techniques; and discrete event  simulation modeling to assess our effectiveness."
5 F30 DA033729-02,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this fellowship is to provide me with the skills and experience needed to be an independent researcher in the field of substance abuse and social epidemiology. This will be accomplished through coursework, mentorship by my sponsor, Dr. Patricia Kissinger, and co-sponsor, Dr. Richard Scribner, and through my own research project. The objective of this project is to investigate the sexual and drug networks of Latino migrant men in order to better understand the risk factors for the transmission of HIV and other sexual transmitted infections (STIs). This project addresses NIDA's research objective to prevent HIV infection and spread among drug users and their partners. A person's social network is crucial in understanding how their environment impacts their risk of HIV. Within networks, it is important to identify core groups since core group members sustain the disease in endemic periods and promote expansion in epidemic periods. While social network analysis is a powerful tool to identify core groups, it is challenging to carry out. Previous studies have used spatial analysis to identify core groups, however these methods have not been validated. If validated, this would provide epidemiologists with a much easier method to identify high risk core groups. This project has three aims: (1) to use spatial analysis to identify core groups of high risk sex among drug users and non-drug users, (2) to compare the sexual networks of drug using and non-drug using Latino migrants, identify core groups of high risk sex and validate spatial analytic techniques used in aim 1 to identify core groups, and (3) to identify risk factors  for belonging to a core group among drug users and non-drug users. My hypothesis is that I will find residual spatial autocorrelation among drug users' sexual networks that is indicative of the presence of core groups. I believe that once I identify core groups using social network analysis in aim 2, membership in a core group will explain the residual spatial autocorrelation seen in aim 1, thus validating spatial techniques to identify core groups. I expect that drug users are at a higher risk of belonging to a core group and that membership to a club or organization will be protective. This study will be carried out by selecting 25 drug using and 25 non-drug using Latino migrant men from a parent study. These men, referred to as egos, will be asked to list and describe all people in their sexual and drug networks. The egos will give referral cards to the people listed in their risk networks, called alters. The first wave of alters, those listed by egos, will be interviewed in the same manner as the egos, and they will also be given referral cards for people in their risk networks. After completing data collection I will have data on the egos, two waves of alters, and information about the second wave alters' networks. Based on data from our parent study, a cohort of 125 Latino migrant workers, we estimate an average of 2.5 people will be reported in a given person's risk networks, totaling approximately 650 people. Data analysis will be carried out in a variety of packages including: SAS, UCInet, and ArcGIS."
5 F31 DA033848-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescents and young adults account for more new HIV infections than individuals in any other age group (CDC, 2008; UNICEF, UNAIDS, & WHO, 2002). High rates of risk-taking behavior among adolescents may be one explanation for the high incidence of HIV in this age group. In particular, unsafe sexual practices and substance use are two classes of behaviors in which adolescents frequently engage, and these behaviors place them at increased risk for HIV infection (CDC, 2010; Kotchick, Shaffer, Miller, & Forehand, 2001; Stein et al., 2000; Tapert, Aarons, Sedlar, & Brown, 2001; Temple & Leigh, 1992). Advancing understanding of the precursors and mechanisms related to adolescent engagement in these risky behaviors is crucial to reducing rates of infection among young people and, thus, has important public health implications.      Converging evidence indicates that family variables and the manner in which individuals cope with distress and regulate emotions are important predictors of adolescent HIV risk behaviors (Brooks, Harris, Thrall, & Woods, 2002; Cooper, Russell, Skinner, Frone, & Mudar, 1992; DiClemente et al., 2001a, 2001b; Fromme & Rivet, 1994; Jaccard, Dittus, & Gordon, 1996; Perrino, Gonzlez-Soldevilla, Pantin, & Szapocznik, 2000). The goal of the proposed study is to further examine the link between parenting variables and adolescent HIV risk behaviors and to explore adolescents' strategies for coping  with distress as a mechanism underlying this link. Specifically, the proposed study will examine the relations among parental responses to adolescents' negative emotions, adolescent suppression of distressing thoughts and emotions as a means of coping, and adolescent HIV risk behaviors-both concurrently and over time-using a multi-method study design that will include self-report, psychophysiological, and laboratory task data. [These data from adolescents (15-19 years old) and their parent(s) will be used to address three study aims: (1) To examine the concurrent link between parental responses to adolescents' negative emotions and adolescent HIV risk behaviors, and test whether adolescents' tendency to use suppression of distressing thoughts and emotions as a coping strategy mediates this link; (2) to examine the concurrent link between the suppression of distressing thoughts and emotions and adolescent HIV risk behavior, and test whether physiological arousal mediates this link; and (3) to examine the longitudinal link between parental responses to adolescents' negative emotions and adolescent HIV risk behaviors, and test whether adolescents' tendency to use suppression of distressing thoughts and emotions as a coping strategy mediates this link.] Results from the proposed study will be discussed in terms of their applicability to HIV prevention programs and their impact on public health.        "
5 F31 DA033913-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV infection rates have increased in the United States to epidemic levels, and many of these new infections occur in adolescents (CDC, 2009). Engaging in risk-taking behaviors such as substance use puts adolescents at heightened risk for HIV infection (Leigh & Stall, 1993). Neurological and environmental reasons have been suggested for this increased risk taking in adolescence: (a) regions of adolescents' brains develop at different rates, affecting their abilities to regulate their actions and in particular assess risks and rewards for engaging in specific behaviors (e.g,, substance use, unprotected sexual intercourse; Geier, Terwilliger, Teslovich, Velanova, & Luna, 2010l Steinberg, 2007); and (b) family-level precursors such as parent-adolescent conflict have been significantly associated with and may pose risk for engaging in substance use and risk-taking (Duncan, Duncan, Biglan, & Ary, 1998). Thus, parent-adolescent conflict may be an important proximal influence in HIV risk behaviors (Lam, Cance, Eke, Fishbein, Hawkins, Williams, 2007; Lester et al., 2010; Rowe, Wang, Greenbaum, & Liddle, 2008). Yet, the temporal relation between parent-adolescent conflict and adolescent HIV risk behaviors is still unknown. Further, it is possible there is a profile of adolescents for whom this conflict increases the likelihood of HIV risk behaviors. To investigate the role of parent-adolescent conflict in HIV risk behaviors, adolescents will be randomly assigned with their parent to complete a standardized discussion task in which they discuss either a control topic (i.e., planning a family vacation) or a conflict topic (i.e., discusing a topic at home that arouses parent-adolescent conflict such as ""doing chores""). Immediately after the discussion task, all adolescents will complete a laboratory risk-taking measure. Adolescents will also complete a self-report measure of real-world risk taking behaviors. The primary aims of the proposed research are to determine if there is a causal link between parent-adolescent conflict and risk-taking behaviors and to identify the factors related to parent-adolescent conflict and HIV risk behaviors for adolescents who score high on the performance-based risk-taking measure. Current substance use is hypothesized to be a moderator of the relation between conflict and risk behaviors. As an exploratory follow-up and with a subsample of adolescents identified as current substance users, investigate the cortical brain regions that moderate the relation between parent-adolescent conflict and risk behaviors using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy device. Training goals for this award are to gain a solid foundation in the conceptualization, development, and neurobehavioral underpinnings of adolescent risk taking, reward processes, and addictions; develop a background in multi-method assessments of family level precursors for HIV risk behaviors; and develop a background in neuroimaging methods.

5 K01 AA020228-04,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed K-01 career development award explores patterns of concurrent sexual partnerships, or partnerships that overlap in time, among urban African Americans in Philadelphia. I am an Assistant Professor of Medicine (Research) in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Brown University Medical School. I hope to use the K-01 award to transition from health policy to behavioral and social science research in HIV/AIDS prevention. My long-term career goals are to pursue an academic career in order to conduct behavioral and sociological research in the field of HIV/AIDS, to publish articles in the peer- reviewed literature, and conduct HIV/AIDS research that influences public policy. I hope to use the K01 award to learn how to conduct community-based participatory research (CPBR), develop new quantitative skills for behavioral science research, acquire expertise in behavioral research for HIV prevention and HIV intervention research, and gain expertise in health disparities research and ethical conduct of research in underserved populations. The research components of my application follow: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches will be employed to explore 32-40 African American community leaders' opinions and knowledge about sexual concurrency and other factors contributing to HIV health disparities among urban African Americans. CBPR will also be used to examine African American community leaders' interest in developing and piloting novel interventions to address concurrent sexual relationships and other factors contributing to HIV health disparities among African Americans. Subsequently, differential rates of sexual concurrency and other factors that may contribute to racial disparities in HIV rates among African Americans testing for HIV in Philadelphia will be explored. This analysis will rely on secondary survey data collected during Philadelphia's rapid testing campaign, which tests approximately 6,000 people annually. The beliefs, attitudes, practices, patterns and causes of concurrent sexual partnerships will then be explored through 80 in-depth qualitative interviews among HIV- negative African American men and women testing for HIV in Philadelphia. In keeping with the CBPR framework guiding this study, the findings of each of the aforementioned research projects will be shared and explored with African American community leaders and the Philadelphia community at large. Community input about the study findings, appropriate interpretations, interventions, and public policy suggestions will be solicited. The findings from the aforementioned studies will then be used to design an R01 grant application proposing an HIV prevention intervention. The intervention will combine behavioral and social interventions to address concurrent sexual partnerships, and may aim to increase condom use rates with main and non-main partners, reduce concurrent sexual partners, or address other factors contributing to HIV health disparities among HIV-negative African Americans."
5 K01 AI091440-04,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a four year career development and training plan for Erik Volz, an Assistant Research Scientist in the Department of Epidemiology at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. Training will aid with the development of a career in Epidemiology with a focus on infectious diseases, especially HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.       The training program will allow Dr. Volz to acquire skills in areas necessary for expertise in the field of HIV epidemiology while conducting substantial research in areas where he already has established a strong publishing record. Dr. Volz will be mentored by a team of three faculty with experience ranging from complex systems modeling of infectious diseases to the microbiology and pathology of HIV infection and the evolution of viruses. The School of Public Health at the University of Michigan is an excellent venue for junior faculty seeking to develop a career as an independent investigator. A large community of research faculty and postdoctoral fellows are available as potential collaborators and as an audience for work in progress.       Research supported by this award will concern the use of novel sources of HIV genetic data for fitting models of the HIV epidemic. The union of mathematical epidemiology, immunology and phylogenetics has been dubbed ""phylodynamics"", and Dr. Volz has made recent progress on the theory necessary to unify traditional models of infectious disease epidemics with the evolution of HIV described by phylogenetic trees. The potential of phylodynamic methods was demonstrated recently as the first estimates of the fundamental reproduction number, R0, for pandemic H1N1 came from the analysis of several dozen influenza genetic sequences, not from traditional epidemiological surveillance data. Dr. Volz hopes to refine these methods and develop them into a practical tool for epidemiologists engaging in HIV surveillance. A collaboration will be established with the Michigan Department of Community Health to analyze a database of several thousand HIV sequences collected from newly diagnosed individuals since 2004. By applying phylodynamic models to this large set of sequences, Dr. Volz will attempt to answer longstanding questions about the transmission patterns of HIV. This research will generate novel estimates of R0, the temporal distribution of transmissions post-infection, the fraction of transmissions that happen during acute and early HIV infection, demographic determinants of infection and transmission risk, and behavioral heterogeneity and sexual network structure.

5 K01 AI095060-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for approximately 10% of the world's population, but is home to approximately 70% of the 2.7 million people estimated to be newly infected with HIV worldwide annually, and 35% of the estimated 8.8 million new tuberculosis (TB) cases. The burden of HIV and TB in Africa is reflected in higher rates of both infections in African emigrants to other countries when compared to their local counterparts. The goal of this career development award is to gain expertise in TB epidemiology and control, and research methodologies that will broaden my abilities to address HIV, TB, and other health issues in the African population in the US. My longer-term career objective is to improve the overall health of this population through both research and public health practice. The proposed research addresses questions crucial to the development of effective HIV and TB prevention and control programs for the African-born population. The specific aims of the proposal are to: 1) Estimate the extent to which transmission of HIV and TB occurs prior to arrival in the US among African-born persons, identify barriers to HIV testing and missed opportunities for HIV diagnoses among African-born US residents, and define the potential risk of ongoing HIV and TB transmission both within and outside of the African-born community; 2) Evaluate missed opportunities for TB screening and diagnosis, describe delays in diagnosis of active TB in the African population compared to non-Africans, and estimate the prevalence of TB genotypes typically seen in African- born patients in non-African populations; and 3) Develop projections for the size and composition of the African-born HIV and TB epidemics in the US over the next 20 years, using a combination of demographic and dynamic epidemic modeling. The career development component of the application is designed to augment my existing skills in the areas of HIV and STD epidemiologic research. The proposed educational aims will allow me to build skills in four specific areas necessary to carry out my research aims, and include training in: 1) TB epidemiology and control, 2) Demography and mathematical modeling, 3) Immigration and health. The unparalleled training environment at the University of Washington (UW), the close and collaborative relationships between the UW and the HIV/STD and TB Programs of Public Health - Seattle and King County, and the exceptional team of mentors and advisors that will supervise my training and research will further contribute to my career development and transition into a successful independent investigator.

5 K01 AI098527-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines a five-year career development and research plan to train the candidate as an independent epidemiologic investigator focused on outcomes research in international settings. The candidate's strong academic performance and international work on HIV-1 risk factors and transmission, including generalizability of prevention interventions, demonstrates his expertise in epidemiologic methodology and applied research. As a doctoral candidate, he led the epidemiologic design and analysis of a large prospective cohort study of discordant couples in Kenya. This research experience was enhanced by a postdoctoral fellowship in which he investigated barriers to timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and developed mathematical models for the impact of the distribution of risk factors on generalizability of intervention trials. This K01 award will enablethe candidate to integrate this background into a new line of investigation on the implementation of behavioral interventions to promote HIV/AIDS care and treatment. The candidate will be supported by expert mentors to provide guidance and ensure the success of this project. An enriching institutional environment will support his career development. RESEARCH PLAN. Half of patients testing positive for HIV-1 at voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) centers in Sub-Saharan Africa fail to link with HIV/AIDS care. This highlights a critical deficiency in the health system that can be addressed with interventions to improve linkage to care that will slow disease progression, accelerate ART initiation, and improve health outcomes. We hypothesize that an implementation science approach will produce a package of interventions to improve linkage to care and treatment that will be rapidly scalable across sites in Africa. We will test a behavioral intervention and evaluate new point-of-care (POC) CD4 testing to improve linkage to care. The specific aims are to (1) determine if a VCT-based intervention of CD4 count testing, alone or in combination with peer counseling, improves linkage to HIV/AIDS care; (2) assess the impact of the intervention on ART initiation; and (3) determine if rapid return of CD4 results using new POC testing improves linkage to care compared to conventional testing with delayed return of results. First, we will conduct a rapid assessment of barriers to care among patients, counselors, and health providers to refine the intervention (VCT-based CD4 counts and peer counseling). We will then recruit 450 HIV-positive individuals from VCTs and randomize a third to standard counseling and referral, a third to receive CD4 testing at the VCT with results return by phone after two weeks, and a third to receive the same CD4 testing combined with peer counseling. We will recruit an additional 150 participants to receive POC CD4 testing with rapid return of results and compare their linkage to care rates to those receiving CD4 results after two weeks. These combined investigations will create a comprehensive understanding of obstacles to appropriate HIV/AIDS care and result in new interventions to achieve measurable outcomes in applied settings. Through this award the candidate will gain new expertise in implementation science and will become an independent investigator focused on health interventions in resource-limited settings.        "

The new qualitative and mixed-methods training coupled with a Ph.D. in public health and prior health services research will prepare the candidate for independent, policy oriented research on complex social and migration factors in HIV prevention in minority and disadvantaged communities. The proposed career and training goals employ didactic and mentored learning to: (1) Develop a thorough understanding of social and environmental factors that contribute to substance use and facilitate transmission of BBIs in migrants; (2) Acquire expertise in developing and implementing mixed-methods protocols (i.e., qualitative and quantitative methods) to study substance use issues; (3) Obtain ongoing training in the ethical conduct in research, especially vis--vis vulnerable populations; (4) Develop the skills necessary for a successful academic research career (e.g., publishing peer reviewed papers, presenting at professional meetings, grantsmanship); and (5) Acquire an in-depth understanding of theory-based interventions that may reduce transmission of BBIs among migrant injection drug users (IDUs). A key aspect of this training involves investigating the influence of migration on risky substance use and sexual behaviors among migrant female sex workers who inject drugs (FSW-IDUs) in Tijuana, a city on the U.S.-Mexico border. The prevalence of HIV in FSW-IDUs is 12.3% This study uses a mixed-methods approach to (1) characterize prior and future migration decisions and resources of FSW- IDUs in Tijuana; (2) Describe the influence of community and family migration experiences on FSW-IDUs' decisions to engage in sex work and substance use behaviors, and (3) Examine the relationship between migration factors and engagement in risky sex and substance use behaviors. Data generated from this study will be used by the applicant to develop an R01 or R34 targeting migrant FSW-IDUs and HIV risks in the U.S.-Mexico border region. RELEVANCE (See instnjections): The "
5 K01 DA029571-04,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K01 proposal entitled ""Moving Toward Independence: Exploring neurological and endocrine determinants of adolescent and young adult risky behavior decision-making"" in response to the program announcement (PA-09-040) proposes a rigorous mixed methods approach to examine how adolescents and young adults (ages 18-24) make decisions about engaging in risky behaviors. This one-year longitudinal study, the first of its kind, incorporates fMRI, salivary samples, genital swabs, and ACASI (Audio Computer Assisted Self-Interview) and in-the-moment text messaging survey methods into one project to examine neurological, hormonal, psychological, and contextual determinants of sexual risk practices and substance use and their related outcomes (e.g., HIV, STIs, substance use disorders, drug dependency, depression). The objective and specific aims of this study are listed below: Objective: The research questions motivating the proposed study are: Why do young adults engage in risky behaviors (sexual and substance use) when they are knowledgeable about consequences? To what extent do these youth experience feelings of depressive symptoms, heightened stress, and physical consequences (e.g., STIs, HIV, drug use disorders)? How do relationships between determinants of risk and outcomes change over time? Aim 1: Assess, using fMRI whether cognitive control brain regions of interest (CCROIs: prefrontal cortex pruning and parietal association cortex; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; ventromedial prefrontal cortex; anterior and posterior cingulate, and temporo-parietal cortices) and socio-emotional brain regions of interest (SEROIs: medial frontal cortex, left ventral striatum - in the accumbens, left superior temporal sulcus, left medial tempor- al, amygdala) are differentially active in youths who take fewer sexual and substance use risks relative to youths taking greater risks. Aim 2: Assess, via four salivary measures per day, whether testosterone (T) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels and diurnal patterns vary as a function of the cognitive control and socio-emotional network brain region activity and development for young women and men. Aim 3: Investigate how activation in cognitive control relative to socio-economic brain networks relates to youths' reports of (a) mental health outcomes and (b) physical health outcomes. By extension, assess how hormone and brain region patterns (e.g., high T with low cognitive control) relate to youths' reports of sexual risk, substance use, drug abuse and dependency, and mental health. Aim 4: Assess changes in brain function as well as hormone diurnal changes over one year's development and whether these changes are related to (1) each other and (2) changes/ stability in sexual risk behavior and substance use outcomes as well as mental health outcomes. At the completion of this project, as a young investigator I will (1) learn the fundamentals of neuroscience and endocrinology, sufficient to launch my independent career, and (2) have a better understanding of how hormones, brain region activity, and context influence a young person's risky behaviors and how these hormones and brain ROI relate to risky behaviors and mental health outcomes over time. This work will advance the current knowledge of adolescent and young adult decision-making and mental health and behavioral outcomes by creating and assessing a more comprehensive model via integrating psychological, biological, and contextual perspectives, and will serve as the basis for an R01 application and future analyses beyond the scope of this study.

The research aims will be accomplished by conducting a cross-sectional study of the social network factors associated with HIV risk behavior among 200 drug-using male clients of female sex workers (FSWs) in Tijuana, Mexico. The US/Mexico border is experiencing a burgeoning HIV epidemic, concentrated among high-risk groups such as drug users and FSWs. Social network analysis (SNA) has been used for many years in the US to understand the role of drug user social networks in regional HIV transmission, but rarely has it been used between regions or across international borders, which are characterized by high levels of cross-border mobility. Understanding the role of social networks in highly mobile ""bridging"" populations is critical to a more nuanced and contextualized understanding of infectious disease transmission in border regions. The proposed research will allow me to apply newly acquired skills in SNA to evaluate the structure, composition, and influence of social networks, and the degree of interaction among drug, sex, and social networks of a particularly high-risk group: US and Tijuana-based drug-using male clients of FSWs. This population exhibits high rates of drug use (25% report ever injecting drugs, and up to 88% report lifetime use of cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamine) and considerable sexual risk behavior with both FSWs and other partners (including 66% who report concurrent sex and drug use). Findings from the proposed research will be critical for developing tailored interventions for individuals at risk for HIV via sex and drug use in border regions, and for the development of future research into the mobility-HIV risk pathway. Further, developing skills in social network analysis will uniquely position me as one of only a handful of mixed-methods researchers in the field of drug abuse possessing such skills, and the only one in the Division of Global Public Health at the University of California San Diego.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The US/Mexico border is home to an evolving HIV epidemic among vulnerable groups such as drug users, including female sex workers (FSWs) and their clients, but little social epidemiological research has assessed the role of social networks in influencing transmission of HIV in this region. Findings from the proposed research will be critical to bi-national efforts to develop tailored interventions for drug users at risk for HIV, and for the development of future long-term research into the influence of social networks on HIV risk among mobile ""bridging"" populations who have the potential to connect higher- and lower-risk groups. Further, developing skills in social network analysis will uniquely position the candidate as one of only a handful of mixed-methods researchers in the field of drug abuse possessing such skills, and the only one in the Division of Global Public Health at the University of California San Diego.

5 K01 DA031035-03,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K01 award will provide Dr. Hong Van Tieu with the necessary training and mentorship to become an independent investigator in HIV epidemiology and prevention. Her short-term goals are to expand her experience in HIV epidemiology and prevention research among men who have sex with men (MSM), gain advanced skills in epidemiology, biostatistics, social network analysis, and qualitative research, and further the understanding of the influence of sexual networks on HIV and sexual risk behaviors among Black and White MSM. She will receive specialized training in the epidemiology of substance use and its relationship to HIV risk among MSM. Her multidisciplinary mentoring team has expertise in HIV and substance use epidemiology, prevention, and clinical research and strong track records of supporting junior faculty to become independently funded investigators. The New York Blood Center has a long history of conducting HIV epidemiology and behavioral and biomedical prevention research among MSM and is profoundly committed to the success of this K01 award. The dramatically disproportionate HIV infection rates among Black MSM in the U.S remain unexplained by differences in individual behavioral risk. One hypothesis is that the characteristics of sexual networks of Black MSM place them at increased risk of HIV compared to non-Black MSM. The purpose of this study is to directly compare the structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks between Black and White MSM and to examine the relationship of their network characteristics to HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors using an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. The proposed research will enroll a large sample of Black and White MSM (n=878) in New York City as a substudy of an NIH R01-funded study to evaluate the hypothesis that certain structural (e.g., network size, density, partner concurrency) and compositional (e.g., assortative and disassortative mixing, durability of relationships) characteristics of Black MSM sexual networks increase the men's risk of HIV infection. The specific aims of this study are the following: (1) to describe and compare the structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks between Black and White MSM at the egocentric network level, (2) to compare the association of structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks with HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors between Black and White MSM at the egocentric network level, and determine whether differences in sexual network characteristics explain the disparity in HIV prevalence between Black and White MSM, and (3) to explore in depth the contexts and meanings of sexual partnerships and networks by evaluating how Black and White MSM subjectively experience their sexual networks and perceive them to influence their sexual risk behaviors using qualitative research methods. A focus of the research is on drug and alcohol use within sexual networks and their relationship to HIV risk among MSM. This research will provide critically important information on the sexual networks of Black MSM to explain the alarming rates of HIV infection among this population and to inform development and testing of sexual network-based intervention strategies to reduce HIV acquisition and transmission risk. It will also serve as an excellent platform for the candidate to gain essential training in HIV epidemiology and prevention research and generate innovative ideas for her first R01 grant application.

5 K01 DA033879-03,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Scientist Career Development Award (K01) will provide the specific training, mentorship, and protected time required to facilitate the candidate's transition to research independence. Her training objectives are to develop advanced skills in geographic information systems (GIS) and sociometric network analysis, receive further training in the ethical conduct of research, particularly in international/cross-cultural settings and acquire skills in grant-writing and collaborative research. These training aims will be accomplished through a combination of didactic coursework and specialized workshops, instruction in the responsible conduct of research, directed readings with mentors, and meetings with training committee members who are nationally and internationally renowned experts in HIV, substance abuse, border health, GIS, and social networks research. The research aims fit well with NIDA's mission to bring ""the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction"" and will be carried out through a study partially embedded in an existing study, El Cuete (R37 DA019829; PI: Strathdee). The specific aims of the proposed research are to: 1) develop GIS models to examine the relationship between neighborhood (colonia) characteristics and clustering of a) HIV and b) recent voluntary drug treatment entry, 2) identify sociometric network attributes associated with a) HIV and b) recent voluntary drug treatment entry and 3) build a multi-level geographically weighted model to examine the independent and combined influence of colonia and sociometric network correlates on a) HIV and b) recent voluntary drug treatment entry. Sixteen ""seeds"" from 8 different colonias in Tijuana, Mexico will be selected from those recently enrolled in El Cuete to initiate the peer recruitment of 300 additional IDUs for the K01 study. To promote geographic diversity in the K01 sample, seeds will be required to report greater mobility (live, inject, and/or buy drugs in >1 colonia). To facilitate peer recruitmnt and the identification of all network ties (a sociometric network), participants will receive 10 recruitment tickets (with a unique recruiter ID, distinct from his/her study ID) and more if needed to distribute to IDU network members. IDU network members may be accompanied to the study site by their recruiter (peer-referral); if they arrive alone, they must correctly identify their per recruiter. Participants will also provide information about IDU network members which will be compared with locator information provided by study participants (in El Cuete and the K01 study) to identify additional network ties. Sociometric network data will be created by 1) connecting peer referrals, 2) linking individuals via recruitment ticket IDs, and 3) matching IDU network member information with that on participant locator forms to identify additional ties. Participants will also provide geocodable points for the locations where he/she spends > 1/2 of his/her time, buys drugs, uses drugs, and socializes. Findings from this proposal will have implications for recruiting hidden populations and will guide the development of future multi-level interventions to reduce HIV transmission and increase voluntary drug treatment entry.

5 K01 DA034523-02,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is threefold. This will allow me to: 1) broaden my understanding of the social epidemiology of HIV among drug users and sex workers in a new cultural and environmental context, 2) learn a new methodology in computational modeling of infectious diseases, and 3) facilitate my transition to becoming a productive NIH-funded independent Investigator at the University of California San Diego. The training aims will be accomplished through a combination of specific workshops and coursework, a hands-on research project, and one-on-one mentoring with a Training Committee comprised of experts in areas of HIV-transmission networks, computational modeling, GIS and geospatial analysis, and HIV social epidemiology research in the US/Mexico border regions. This research will be accomplished by conducting multidisciplinary studies on the computational modeling of HIV/STI transmission to construct, validate, and calibrate a computer simulation model reflecting the complex interdependences between individual behavior and environmental influence on HIV/STI. This project will leverage data from an existing NIH/NIDA-funded R01, DA028692-01 (""Evolving HIV/STI risk environments of female sex workers (FSWs) on the Mexico/US border"" aka Proyecto Mapa de Salud, PI Kimberly Brouwer) in order to capitalize on the infrastructure and expertise represented by that project. The US/Mexico border is experiencing a burgeoning HIV epidemic, concentrated among high-risk groups such as drug users and FSWs. Computational modeling has been routinely used in areas such as disease epidemiology, health care capacity, and patient flows in emergency care to capture the complex behavior of system but have been slower to be adopted in health-related behavioral and social science research. Computational modeling offers the unique opportunity to address the casual mechanism of HIV/STI risk by examining cyclic relationship of individuals interacting within their environment and in turn their  environment shaping risk-related behaviors. The proposed research will allow me to apply newly acquired skills in computational modeling to develop a robust simulation of HIV/STI transmission as we change the context of risks including factors measured at the behavioral, social, physical, and geographical level. This model will be validated and calibrated with extant data sampled from a particularly high-risk population in Tijuana where HIV prevalence among women participating in sex work is 21%. Findings from this research will enhance scientific understanding on which environmental determinants affect population-levels of HIV/STI transmission and could have major implications for the types of evidence that are used to make policy decision and public health interventions. Further, developing skills in computational modeling will uniquely position me as only one of a handful of quantitative methodological researchers in the field of drug abuse possessing such skills, and the only one in the Division of Global Public Health at the University of California, San Diego.

5 K01 TW008410-04,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Mental disorders often co-occur with HIV/AIDS, yet continue to be left undiagnosed and untreated in Kenya.  These disorders are associated with poor medication adherence, risky sexual behavior, and ultimately the  continued spread of HIV/AIDS. Therefore, there is a critical need for effective assessment and treatment of  mental disorders such as major depression and alcohol use disorders particularly among people living with  or at risk for HIV/AIDS. Although major advances in the effective assessment and treatment of psychiatric  and alcohol use disorders have been made, these evidence-based methods are often not adapted and  tested in developing countries such as Kenya. The broad objective of this International Research Scientist  Development Award (IRSDA) is to promote evidence-based assessment and treatment of psychiatric and  alcohol use disorders through a translational approach that is both culturally appropriate and sustainable.  The specific aims of the research plan are to 1) Assess the prevalence of psychiatric and alcohol use  disorders among adults living with HIV/AIDS and adults being tested for HIV at a health clinic located in a  slum community of Nairobi, Kenya, and 2) Implement and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a  culturally relevant, sustainable, mental health referral and alcohol use disorder intervention program for  these adults. The candidate will conduct both qualitative and quantitative tests of the psychometric properties  of all assessment tools and intervention programs to be implemented. Supervised clinical psychology  Masters students will be used for this sustainable treatment model. The long-term objectives of this research  are to help build the capacity of primary care health clinics in underprivileged areas of Kenya such that they  are able to promote mental health care for all their patients and particularly the growing number with alcohol  use disorders. The candidate proposes to implement this research plan during a period of close mentored  training with experts in mental health assessment and treatment in both the United States and Kenya. The  proposed mentored training for the candidate will enable her transition towards independence as an  international mental health epidemiologist."
5 K08 AI081545-03,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many important biological determinants of HIV-1 disease progression and transmission map to the envelope glycoprotein, including antibody neutralization susceptibility, viral tropism for entry and epitopes for T cell response. Genetic and phenotypic characterizations of the envelope gene suggest a bottleneck effect in the spread of the virus to other body compartments and transmission, resulting in a predominantly homogenous viral population. However, the limitations in current methods to accurately assign HIV-1 coreceptor usage, distinguish genetic variations and detect minor variants in the HIV quasispecies within a patient and between transmission pairs have led to controversial findings. Furthermore, the small patient sample size studied has been too small to make broad generalization regarding mechanisms of HIV transmission and pathogensis. Lastly, these various properties of the envelope gene have been studied predominantly in subtype B infection and less clearly elucidated in HIV-1 subtype C, the most rapidly spreading and prevalent infection worldwide. We hypothesize that a heterogenous HIV-1 population with different envelope sequences and coreceptor usage are transmitted during infection but is not fully characterized and measured by our current available techniques. We propose to use novel and more sensitive methods to determine coreceptor usage and to perform in-depth sequencing and genetic analyses of the envelope gene from a large subtype C clinical cohort from Botswana. The envelope gene in subtype C infection will be studied in longitudinal samples, as well as between plasma-breast milk and mother-infant pairs. We plan to study in greater depth the properties of the HIV-1 subtype C envelope glycoprotein with the following specific aims: 1) identify clinical and genetic determinants of coreceptor switching, 2) assess for correlates of breastfeeding transmission of HIV-1 and 3) examine pattern of viral transmission among mother-to-child transmitting pairs occurring through different routes of MTCT using ultradeep sequencing. The results of this study will further the understanding of viral evolution in the context of transmission and disease progression, identify clinical correlates of transmission and disease progression, and ultimately give insights into potential strategies of prevention, treatment and vaccine development in those parts of the world most affected by HIV.

5 K08 HD060451-04,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dr. Minh Dinh is a junior faculty researcher at Northwestern University, a leading institution in HIV research. The institution fully supports her research endeavors with extensive resources available to her in the Hope and Wolinksy labs, as well as other areas on campus. Her mentor is Dr. Thomas Hope, a well-published researcher in HIV pathogenesis and transmission. Dr. Hope's mentorship and expertise will greatly enhance her research efforts in the upcoming years. Dr. Dinh plans to maintain a career in academic medicine in the field of HIV transmission and prevention research. She will nurture the development of her early career at Northwestern with continued graduate studies in virology and biology, and regular meetings and conferences in the fields of virology and infectious diseases. Her work in the Hope lab has been highly productive to date, and holds promise for a successful career in HIV research.  Several randomized control clinical trials have demonstrated the protective benefit of male circumcision in reducing the risk of HIV acquisition in men. The primary objective of my research plan is to gain insight into the biologic mechanism behind this protective effect.  Our lab has developed strategies to visualize various aspects of HIV activity and have successfully used these methods to study HIV transmission in tissue. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, I will study adult human penile epithelium from circumcised and uncircumcised cadaveric specimens. I will first characterize structural and cellular components to determine differences between tissues from these two groups. Using ex vivo tissue explant cultures, I will also investigate early interactions between photactivatable HIV GFP-Vpr viral particles and male genital tissue, including how the particles move through the epithelia. Long-term explant cultures will allow me to visualize target cells such as Langerhans and CD4+ T-cell lymphocytes that have been successfully infected by HIV. My hypothesis is that HIV more easily penetrates and infects underlying target cells in foreskin tissue and uncircumcised penile tissue, leading to increased rates of HIV infection in uncircumcised men. In collaboration with the HIV Vaccine Trials Network, I will examine structural and cellular features in and photoactivatable HIV with foreskin tissue obtained from Merck Ad5-HIV-1 vaccine trial participants to determine the vaccine's effect on these areas. I predict that the vaccine and pre-existing HSV infections increased localized target cell recruitment that led to higher HIV infection risks upon exposure to the virus.  My next aim is to study HIV sexual transmission using the male rhesus macaque model. Macaque models have allowed us to confirm findings from human female cervical explant cultures and these experiments with male macaques will similarly be crucial to our studies. I will have short-term access to retired animals from other Tulane studies, along with 10 circumcised macaques acquired for a separate study. Skin barrier function will be assessed using transepidermal water loss measurements. Circumcised and uncircumcised male macaque genitalia will be inoculated with photoactivatable HIV-1 to study initial interactions in a living model. Tissue will be studied for target cells, keratin, and intercellular junctions. Long-term tissue explants inoculated with SIV GFP-Vpx constructs will be used to study early SIV infected cells. Altogether, these high impact studies will help us to better understand how male circumcision effects HIV transmission in men.      "
5 K08 HD069201-03,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breastfeeding can account for up to 39% of pediatric HIV infections. In developed countries, HIV-infected mothers feed formula to their infants to prevent postpartum HIV transmission. However, in many parts of the developing world, formula is unaffordable and is associated with high morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases such as gastroenteritis and malnourishment. Therefore, the current WHO guidelines recommend that HIV-infected mothers from most underdeveloped settings breastfeed their infants. Multiple observational, prospective studies have shown that exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) reduces the risk of mother-to-child- transmission (MTCT) two to tenfold compared to infants that are mixed-fed (MF) with other milks, liquids, or solids in addition to breast. EBF decreases morbidity even in non-HIV-exposed infants in both developed and developing settings. EBF decreases morbidity even in non-HIV-exposed infants in both developed and developing settings. However, EBF is difficult for mothers to maintain, and infants are given complementary foods after four to six months of age. In addition, a study of EBF with rapid weaning at four months showed high morbidity in the uninfected infants. Understanding the mechanisms associated with this increased risk could lead to interventions to make mixed feeding and complementary feeding safer for infants. One potential explanation for the protective effect of EBF is that the addition of non-breast milk liquids and solids alters the infant's mucosal or immunologic barriers of the upper gastrointestinal tract. This could lead to immune cell activation with an increase HIV target cells at the mucosa, or increased microbial translocation across the gut, possibly due to compromised mucosal integrity or increased gastrointestinal and/or systemic infections. This project tests the hypothesis that mixed fed infants will display evidence for immune activation within both mucosal and systemic compartments when compared to EBF infants (Aim 1), by measuring immune activation in the blood and in saliva of infants with different feeding practices. This increase in immune activation could be due to changes in the gut commensal organisms in early life (Aim 2). Therefore, these experiments will analyze the microbes in stool of these babies. This activation is possibly derived from mixed feeding- induced mucosal impairment or infections and the consequent translocation of bacterial products across the gut mucosa into the systemic circulation (Aim 3), therefore our experiments will measure microbial products in blood. Through assessment of these infants at multiple time points (6 and 14 weeks of age), this study plans to evaluate the mechanisms conferring EBF infants a reduced risk of HIV infection, and to uncover targets for MTCT prevention during mixed feeding, and to potentially benefit all infants globally who cannot EBF.

5 K23 AI083100-05,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV in sub-Saharan Africa is almost exclusively transmitted by heterosexual sex. Prospective randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in Africa, including 2 conducted by Hopkins researchers in Uganda, demonstrate that adult male circumcision reduces HIV acquisition by 60% and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) acquisition."" Little is known about the immunology and pathophysiology of the foreskin. We propose to describe the immunology of foreskin inflammation and assess its role in HIV and HSV-2 acquisition and transmission using data and foreskin specimens obtained from the circumcision RCTs. The Hopkins Uganda circumcision trials enrolled both HIV+ and HIV--index male subjects and their female partners and archived the surgical foreskin specimens. With this repository, we have a unique opportunity to evaluate this hypothesis and to understand inflammation in the foreskin. The K23 candidate, Dr. Kristine Johnson, has specific interests in HIV immunology and sexually transmitted infections. The proposal provides for structured training and mentorship support to develop a translational research program to explore these relationships.       Using methods already developed by Dr. Johnson, she will define local lymphocyte populations within the foreskin tissues, by confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Using tissue PCR, she will quantify and characterize associated inflammation patterns and tissue HIV and HSV-2 viral content. After this work is completed, using the rich data collected on index subjects and partners, she will assess the impact of the foreskin cellular components on HIV acquisition events among initially HIV-uninfected men and the impact of foreskin cellular and viral components on HIV transmission events to serodiscordant female partners.       Kristine Johnson, MD, joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins University Division of Infectious Diseases in July 2008. This application integrates epidemiology and immunological approaches using a unique sample set to answer critical questions in HIV/HSV-2 transmission. There is an especially strong mentorship team of experts in HIV/STI transmission and prevention, including Drs. Jonathan Zenilman, Ronald Gray and Thomas Quinn.       RELEVANCE: As a beginning, we propose here to evaluate relationships between foreskin inflammation, epithelial lymphocyte populations, cytokines and HIV and HSV-2 infection and transmission. The results of this work will lead to a better understanding of the male foreskin immune milieu and may inform the development of new modalities for targeted HIV and STI prevention.             "
5 K23 AI093152-03,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oncogenic HPV, mucosal immune response and risk of HIV acquisition. Approximately 33 million people are infected with HIV worldwide, with 2.7 million new infections in 2008 alone. The infection disproportionately affects sub-Saharan Africa with 67% of all HIV infections and 75% of all HIV/AIDS deaths. High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection leads to anogenital cancers, including cervical cancer (the third leading cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide). HR-HPV may also be a risk factor for HIV acquisition, presumably due to recruitment of HIV target cells into the mucosa. However, the genital mucosal immunologic microenvironment and HIV/HR-HPV interactions are poorly understood. Male circumcision reduces the risk of HIV and HR-HPV, demonstrating the critical role of the foreskin in acquisition and transmission of these viral infections. Foreskin tissue, genital swabs of men and their female partners, and epidemiologic data from male circumcisions in Rakai, Uganda, provide biological samples to assess HIV and HR-HPV mucosal immunologic interactions. We hypothesize that HR-HPV clearance induces a distinct proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine profile and increased foreskin mucosal T-cell densities which are associated with increased risk of HIV acquisition. We propose the following aims. 1) Assess whether clearance of pre-existing HR-HPV infection and/or acquisition of a new HR-HPV genotype are associated with an increased risk of HIV acquisition in men and women using a case-control design in which cases will be HIV seroconverters and controls will be persistently HIV-negative individuals. 2) Characterize the foreskin cellular mucosal immunologic response associated with HR-HPV in HIV+ and HIV-negative men. 3) Compare cytokine/chemokine concentrations in penile swabs associated with HR-HPV and HIV infection status. <4) Determine whether increased foreskin immunologic cell densities and penile proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines are associated with HR-HPV clearance.> The foreskin mucosa, genital swabs and epidemiologic data provide a unique opportunity to study HIV and HR-HPV infection and could potentially inform the development of HIV preventive measures. This K23 grant will contribute to the professional and scientific development of a physician scientist. The applicant has completed an NIH-funded MD/PhD program and a clinical pathology residency. This grant will enable the applicant to develop proficiency in epidemiology and biostatistics and, building on the proposed research program, to design and manage an independent RO1-level research program in molecular/clinical epidemiology. The applicant will utilize the strengths of his mentors and the Rakai Health Science Program in Uganda (one of the largest and longest-running population-based HIV and infectious diseases cohorts in sub- Saharan Africa) to learn how to design, implement, manage and analyze international HIV research studies.

5 K23 AI093163-03,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Introduction: The poor fidelity of the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme leads to a significant sequence diversity across infected individuals. Although this complicates antiretroviral therapy, this diversity allows researchers to characterize relationships between sampled viruses using phylogenetic tools. Once the phylogenetic relationships of HIV sampled from infected individuals are characterized, socio-demographic data from the sampled individuals may be overlaid onto these phylogenetic relationships leading to inferred reconstruction of social networks that may create a better understanding of socio-demographic patterns and drivers of the sampled epidemic. Previous work has characterized some of the risk factors for HIV infection in both San Diego, CA and Tijuana, Mexico. We propose to utilize objective sequence data along with clinical and socio-demographic data to improve the understanding of the relationship of the HIV-1 sub-epidemics along the San Diego-Tijuana border. Methods: In this proposal, sequence, clinical, and socio-demographic data gathered from HIV positive individuals enrolled in seven different collaborating cohorts along the San Diego- Tijuana border will be combined for analysis. HIV pol sequence data will be collected from the collaborating cohorts or generated from blood samples provided by them. Socio-demographic and clinical data will be abstracted from the databases of the cohorts in a de-identified manner, except for location of residence. Maximum likelihood based methods will then be used to determine the phylogenetic structure (i.e. clustering) of the sampled sequences, and then associations between the clustering and socio-demographic variables will be assessed including: location of residence, HIV risk factors, drug resistance, duration of infection, cross- border movement, and others. We will next determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of the HIV epidemics across the border region using geographic information systems, and coalescent theory based Bayesian phylogeographic analyses. These analyses can incorporate temporal and geographic data into the prior estimations of phylogenetic structure so that the final results may identify temporal and spatial transmission 'hot spots'. In order to address privacy issues, all geographic data will be smoothed at the time of presentation so that identification of individuals will not be possible. We will also work closely with our bioinformatics colleagues to understand the limitations of our convenience data, and develop statistical techniques to make our findings generalizable. Conclusions: We anticipate that our findings will improve understanding of HIV transmission dynamics in this region so that prevention strategies can be designed and targeted more effectively.       This research project has two major aims: 1) to identify risk factors related to HIV transmission, and 2) identify temporal and spatial 'hot spots of transmission in the San Diego-Tijuana border region. These results will assist public health agencies in Mexico and the US to more efficiently develop appropriate and targeted intervention strategies to curb ongoing HIV transmission.            "
5 K23 AI096923-03,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this career development award is for Dr. Philip A. Chan to acquire the training and experience necessary to become an independent clinical investigator. The career goals of this proposal are to gain expertise in the field of HIV-oriented molecular epidemiology including familiarity with biostatistics and study design, to become skilled using molecular phylogenetics to study HIV transmission patterns and population dynamics, to acquire experience in HIV behavior and prevention sciences, and to receive proper training in the Responsible Conduct of Research including ethical practices. The number of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected individuals continues to increase in the United States, propagated by transmission in social networks among high-risk groups. Identification of networks within which HIV transmission occurs can lead to targeted screening and effective prevention interventions. Current HIV epidemiologic contact tracing programs implemented by public health departments are often limited by reporting and recall bias secondary to the lag time between infection and diagnosis as well as the reluctance of HIV-infected individuals to report partners. This research proposal integrates molecular epidemiology and public health programs to identify transmission networks and develop behavior assessment and intervention tools. In collaboration with other major academic centers in Rhode Island and the Department of Health, molecular epidemiology will be used to enhance contact tracing programs and develop future targeted prevention strategies. The objectives of the research are to: 1) Identify transmission networks among HIV- infected individuals using molecular phylogenetic approaches; 2) Determine risk factors and characteristics associated with transmission networks that may be targeted for interventions; and 3) Identify contacts of individuals forming transmission networks to diagnose HIV-infected yet unaware cases, characterize risk behaviors, and assess acceptability of novel prevention interventions. This research will allow a comprehensive investigation of HIV epidemiology and development of an effective public health model that can be implemented elsewhere. During the course of this award, Dr. Chan will be mentored by experts from Brown University in the field of molecular genetics and HIV epidemiology including Dr. Rami Kantor (primary mentor) and Dr. Kenneth Mayer.

5 K23 HD071788-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a 5-year training and research program that will allow the investigator to achieve her goal of becoming an independent patient-oriented researcher. She will use her expertise in international clinical research to improve reproductive health and survival of African women living with HIV-1. The proposed program will build on the candidate's extensive experience with international clinical research by improving her skills in study design and epidemiologic analysis of longitudinal data and improving her understanding of immunology and its application in patient-oriented research. The training plan incorporates an outstanding mentoring environment and involves collaboration between clinical researchers at the University of Washington and the University of Nairobi. Research Plan - HIV-1 infected pregnant women and contraception users have increased HIV-1 genital shedding and disease progression, but the mechanism behind these changes is poorly understood. Systemic T-cell immune activation has been linked to shedding and progression. We propose to measure systemic and local immune activation among these two groups of women. Aim 1) to determine whether postpartum hormonal contraception use affects systemic immune activation markers; Aim 2) to determine whether users of postpartum contraception have increased local immune activation, increased genital tract or breast milk HIV-1 shedding, and Aim 3) to describe differences in systemic immune activation in African HIV-1-seropositive and seronegative women throughout pregnancy and postpartum. The results of these analyses can be used to create a clearer picture of immunologic function in pregnancy and the postpartum period among HIV-1-infected women in Africa, to clarify mechanisms by which pregnancy and hormonal contraception may impact genital and breast milk HIV-1 shedding and disease progression, and ultimately to optimize recommendations for promoting appropriate family planning among these women. This opportunity will seed a larger research program to understand interactions of contraception, the immune system and HIV-1, and to use this knowledge to improve women's reproductive health.

She is Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.  Mentors: Dr. Deborah Jones is Research Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine with extensive experience in behavioral research   interventions to reduce sexual risk in HIV infected men and women domestically and internationally. Dr. Fischl is Professor of Medicine at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and  an acknowledged world leader in the field of HIV clinical research. Drs. Jones and Fischl both have extensive mentorship experience and will ensure the success of Dr. Alcaide's training, proposed studies and career development.  Research: Intravaginal practices (VP) are common among women in sub-Saharan and implicated in the development of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and HIV transmission. Building on pilot study results from Zambia obtained by Dr. Alcaide (R01HD058481S~ Alcaide et al., 2011), this study will develop and test a bio-behavioral intervention designed to decrease VP. The pilot study tested a bio-behavioral intervention and results support its effectiveness in reducing both VP and BV over 8 weeks. The current proposal will evaluate the long term impact of a bio-behavioral intervention targeting VP among HIV infected women in Lusaka, Zambia, and assess the relative contribution of VP and BV to genital inflammation and HIV shedding. Aim 1.1 will develop and evaluate the long term impact of a bio-behavioral intervention to decrease VP. Aim 1.2 will compare rates of BV, genital inflammatory markers and HIV shedding in HIV infected women engaging in VP with and without BV.

5 K24 HL075036-10,"Dr. Murphy is a well-established, well-funded and productive researcher who has productively utilized the K24 mechanism during the first funding period to leverage his participation in patient oriented research (POR) and to devote substantial additional time to training and mentoring. He has been successful in traditional mentoring of graduate students, fellows and junior faculty towards their own career in POR. More novel, but still fully within the scope of the K24 award's intent, he has instituted a dynamic new program in POR training for transfusion medicine MD's and PhD's in developing countries that will lead to a new generation of researchers devoted to improving the safety and availability of blood transfusion on a worldwide basis. Finally, there are still competing demands for time and funded salary between research and training activities and remaining commitments to administrative duties. Although medium-long term mentorship has been successful, the international program is still young and the applicant would like more time for several promising trainees from the short course to transition to medium to long term mentorship. An additional five years of funding is requested to enable the formation of a Center of Excellence in POR training in international transfusion safety:     Continue and expand his program of high quality POR, with a research concentration on the health outcomes of transfusion transmitted viruses and genetic epidemiology.   Continue and increase medium- and long-term mentorship under the umbrella of the UCSF CTSI, UC Berkeley School of Public Health and the new roadmap K12 Masters and Ph.D. programs at UCSF.   Expand and obtain independent funding for international training activities, in collaboration with the UCSF Institute for Global Health, and NIH Fogarty International Center training grants   Further strengthen his own research team, promoting the independence of junior faculty and a joint (UCSF and BSRI) recruitment of a genetic epidemiologist to aid the laboratory's expansion into this new area of research."
5 P01 HD064915-05-6851,"Pregnancy and the postpartum period have been associated with increased risk of HIV-1. In Africa, where  both HIV-1 seroprevalence and fertility rates are high, the pregnancy/postpartum period may be one in  which HIV-1 acquisition contributes substantially to HIV-1 in women. Pregnancy, delivery, and the  postpartum period are associated with hormonal, genital mucosal, and genital flora changes that could  predispose to acquisition of HIV-1. Project 1 will enroll 2,000 HIV-1 uninfected women identified during  pregnancy and followed to 9 months postpartum to determine risk and cofactors of HIV-1 incidence. Women  who acquire HIV-1 will be compared to women who do not in order to determine the role of genital coinfections,  ulcers, delivery practice, lactation, partner characteristics, vaginal flora changes, HSV-2, genital  innate immune factors, and systemic immune activation on HIV-1 transmission. In addition, changes in  cofactors over the course of pregnancy and postpartum may influence susceptibility to HIV-1. Thus, in a  subset of 100 women we will compare genital innate immune factors, and systemic cellular immune  activation longitudinally during pregnancy, early postpartum, and later postpartum. These comparisons will  provide opportunity to determine patterns of change in the genital tract during this dynamic period of change  in women. In quantifying co-infections, mucosal innate immune responses, and systemic cellular immune  activation, we will be able to determine interactions between these important determinants in 3 different but  inter-related areas (co-infection, mucosal innate milieu, systemic cellular) that affect susceptibility to HIV-1.  Project 1 will have scientific links to Project 2 (effects of changes in vaginal flora on HIV-1 transmission),  Project 3 (which will involve cytokine profile analyses within women from the Project 1 cohort) and Project 4  (adaptive humoral mucosal responses in HIV-1 uninfected women with HIV-1 infected partners). Because of  the complexity of the female genital ecosystem and the variety of factors that could alter susceptibility to  HIV-1, each Project will focus on complementary factors that may modify transmission of HIV-1. Together,  these will lead to a multi-faceted evaluation of transmission in women in different important groups of  women at risk for HIV-1, (pregnant/postpartum, female sex workers, and discordant couples), that  conceivably share some cofactors for HIV-1 susceptibility but are distinct in others."
5 P01 HD064915-05-6858,"The majority of adult HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa occur in women, highlighting the importance of  understanding HIV risk in this population. Numerous studies have suggested that perturbations of vaginal  bacterial flora, including bacterial vaginosis (BV), may increase women's risk of HIV acquisition. Recently,  molecular techniques for characterization of vaginal flora have enhanced our knowledge of the central role  of uncultivated organisms in the microbial ecology of BV. Indeed, several novel bacterial species appear to  be substantially more predictive of BV than bacteria previously identified through culture. Understanding the  role of vaginal flora in mediating HIV risk is an important HIV prevention goal.  The overarching aim of this proposal is to use cutting-edge molecular approaches to test the hypothesis that  the presence of specific bacteria in the vaginal flora is associated with increased risk for HIV acquisition. To  accomplish this objective, we will conduct a nested case-control study utilizing prospectively collected data  from NIH-funded cohorts of women at risk for HIV in Mombasa and Kisumu, Kenya. Vaginal bacterial flora  will be evaluated using two distinct and complementary molecular techniques: (1) quantitative 16S  ribosomal DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify and quantify species that are frequently  associated with BV, and (2) broad range PCR with pyrosequencing (deep sequencing) to identify minority  species and broad patterns of vaginal bacterial communities in women who acquire HIV versus those who  remain HIV-seronegative.  The proposed studies will be conducted by an experienced multidisciplinary team including basic scientists,  clinicians, epidemiologists, and biostatisticians with an established record of collaborative HIV research in  women."
5 P01 HD064915-05-6861,"Multiple biological cofactors have been shown to increase a woman's susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, including sexually transmitted diseases, vaginal flora, hormonal contraceptive use and pregnancy. Many of these factors cause inflammation or immune activation, suggesting a possible mechanism for their affect on HIV-1 susceptibility. The proposed aims of this project will test the hypothesis that innate immune conditions, including immune activation and inflammation, impact HIV-1 susceptibility in women. The foundation for this hypothesis comes from many observations, including the above-mentioned results suggesting that several of the biological cofactors for HIV-1 acquisition alter innate immunity, the fact that immune activation is known to make CD4+T lymphocytes more permissive to infection, and the fact that immune activation early in HIV-1 infection appears to fuel virus replication and disease progression. Although there are several lines of support for this hypothesis, the association between inflammation or immune activation has never been directly examined in relation to risk of HIV-1 acquisition in women. We propose to test this hypothesis by examining cytokine profiles, which provide a surrogate marker of innate immune conditions, just prior to the time of HIV-1 infection, in relation to risk of HIV-1 infection in several populations. The cohorts for these studies will include a 14 year seroincident female cohort in Mombasa, Kenya and a cohort of pregnant women in Nairobi, Kenya. We will take advantage of banked samples and clinical data from the Mombasa cohort as well as samples and data collected as part of Projects 1 and 2 to address the Aims of Project 3. This integration with long-term cohort studies by our group and with the new studies in other Projects will provide considerable opportunities for synergy among projects in the program grant. It will also permit a comprehensive study of innate immune factors at the time of HIV-1 acquisition across multiple high-risk cohorts that will include women with various biological cofactors of importance in determining risk of HIV-1 acquisition in women. RELEVANCE (See instructions): These studies will provide critical data on the characteristics of the innate immune response that impact risk of HIV-infection in women, including women in multiple high-risk groups. In addition, the study is designed to identify a cytokine profile that is associated with increase risk of HIV acquisition in women. This profile may provide a useful surrogate marker for monitoring the impact of new prevention methods, particularly microbicides."

5 P60 DA011015-15,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This revised proposal requests continued support for a Comprehensive P60 Center to extend our study of antisocial drug dependence to encompass its implications for HIV/AIDS. The overall goal of this competitive renewal application is to contribute to our understanding of the etiology of individual differences in behavioral disinhibition, the relationship of this to drug abuse and the development of dependence, and the role that these play in the propensity for risky behaviors that may result in STDs, including HIV/AIDS. Our unique focus has been the contribution of genetics, both through linkage and association studies, and biometrical behavior genetic studies. Our overall thesis is that: Most new American HIV infections occur when adolescents or adults choose to engage in unprotected sexual behaviors or drug behaviors well known to be dangerous. Identifiable genes of some persons produce a lifelong behavioral disposition that involves excessive pursuit of exciting appetitive stimuli and unusual disregard of aversive consequences for behavior, a ""behavioral disinhibition"". These characteristics frequently lead to substance abuse or dependence, antisocial behavior, and engagement in risky behaviors. Eventually, specification of the genetic and environmental factors influencing this behavioral disposition will lead to improved therapies that may reduce the vulnerability to engage in substance abuse, antisocial behavior, and risky behavior. In pursuit of this thesis we propose the following studies: 1) to identify specific genetic loci that influence behavioral disinhibition, we will conduct a genome-wide association study on an existing sample of 1000 adolescent cases and 1000 controls with Substance Dependence, Conduct Disorder, and HIV-related risk behaviors, and a newly ascertained sample of 600 adolescents recruited from adolescent substance abuse treatment programs and a control sample of 600 adolescents without serious substance or behavioral problems. 2) We will collect a third assessment in young adulthood on the clinical families and community family and twin samples participating in the Center, with detailed assessments of HIV risk behaviors. 3) We will conduct brain imaging studies to explore a neural basis for risky behaviors in disinhibited individuals, and explore the association of SNPs identified in '1' with activation of brain regions of interest, and 4) we will conduct a series of pilot studies of innovative approaches to the genetics of HIV risk behaviors. These projects will be supported by cores providing: A) Administrative, Educational, and Ethics support; B) Data management, informatics, and biostatistics; C) Genotyping and molecular genetics.  "
5 R01 AA018631-04,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol is the most commonly used recreational drug in sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of HIV cases are located. Uganda has one of the highest rates of per capita alcohol consumption in the world. Alcohol has a substantial impact on the sub-Saharan African HIV epidemic via increased risk for sexual transmission of HIV and decreased adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), which may lead to treatment failure. We have observed a high rate of self-reported natural recovery from hazardous drinking in the absence of alcohol treatment in a cohort of HIV positives initiating ART in Mbarara, Uganda. More than half (56%) of participants who reported hazardous drinking in the year prior to study entry and 70% of those who reported moderate drinking in the prior year reported that they had abstained from drinking alcohol in the prior 3 months. The majority of those who reported that they had stopped drinking remained abstinent throughout follow-up of up to three years. It is possible that decreases in self-reported alcohol consumption are due to under-report of current versus past alcohol use as a result of stigma associated with alcohol consumption or fear of losing access to ART. On the other hand, decreases may be due to real reductions in alcohol consumption concurrent with declining health, behavioral counseling conducted at the HIV clinic, or pressure from family, friends, and/or treatment supporters. We propose a prospective cohort study of 212 HIV positive alcohol consumers to quantify changes in alcohol consumption during the first year of HIV care. We have recently validated several biomarkers of heavy alcohol consumption-direct metabolites of alcohol that may be detected for extended periods of time after alcohol itself has left the body-and we propose to use the best of these measures as an adjunct to self-report and to estimate under-report of heavy alcohol consumption. We will conduct qualitative observations of HIV clinic sessions (n=60) in order to examine how alcohol reduction is approached in that setting. We will additionally examine reasons for changes in alcohol consumption in quantitative and qualitative studies, using prior clinic observations to inform this inquiry. The long-term goal of this study is to quantify changes in alcohol consumption during HIV care and to determine factors predictive of such change to inform future interventions to decrease alcohol consumption. This proposal is directly responsive to the NIAAA Five-Year Strategic Plan goal to identify biological and contextual social factors that contribute to changes in drinking behavior.      "
5 R01 AA018923-05," PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Few treatments have been evaluated to reduce the impact of heavy drinking, alcohol abuse and dependence on HIV-infected patients. These levels of alcohol consumption are associated with decreased adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), an increased likelihood of viral mutations, enhanced disease progression, promotion of liver injury, and increased sexual risk taking. Naltrexone, when combined with counseling, is an effective treatment for heavy drinking, alcohol abuse and dependence yet there are no data on its use or efficacy in HIV-infected patients. The proposed study compares naltrexone to placebo in a 24- week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in HAART-non-adherent HIV-infected patients with heavy drinking, alcohol abuse or dependence (N=154 ) in an HIV clinic. To determine the long-term impact of treatment, all patients will undergo follow-up at 9 and 12 months. Patients randomized to naltrexone will initially receive the oral daily formulation and, if tolerated, will be transferred to the monthly extended release formulation. All patients will receive the counseling platform of Medication Management (MM) combined with Medication Coaching (MC) (MM/MC). MM/MC is a compound manualized treatment intended to approximate the type of treatment that would be suitable for implementation in an HIV primary care setting. It focuses on reducing heavy drinking (MM) and improving medication adherence (MC) through a series of brief interventions delivered by a medically trained provider. Data analyses will be conducted on the intention to treat sample of patients randomly assigned to receive naltrexone + MM/MC versus placebo + MM/MC. The primary study outcome is adherence to HAART medications. Secondary study outcomes include frequency of heavy drinking, HIV viral mutations (using standard assays and ultra-deep sequencing), change in CD4 lymphocyte counts and HIV RNA, alcohol-HAART hepatotoxicity, and sexual risk behaviors. The novel aspects of this proposal include: 1) Integrated on-site alcohol and HIV treatment; 2) The use of extended release naltrexone which is likely to improve adherence in this patient population for whom medication adherence is challenging; 3) The use of several measures for HAART adherence including pharmacy refill data; 4) The use of sophisticated techniques for examining the development of new viral mutations including the detection of new minor variants; and 5) Collection of detailed data on the hepatic effects of treatment. The proposed study, conducted by an experienced team of HIV and addiction researchers, will help define the role of naltrexone and evidence-based counseling in HAART-non-adherent subjects with alcohol problems."
5 R01 AI084691-03,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because retroviruses like HIV-1 evolve so rapidly, viral genetic sequences retrieved from just a few decades before present are effectively molecular 'fossils'. Such fossil sequences can be used to provide indisputable evidence of the existence of a given microbe at an early time point, to validate historical inferences that could otherwise not be tested, and to provide insight into the current evolution and dynamics of the AIDS pandemic. They light up portions of the deep past that would otherwise be lost, and can provide the means to test important hypotheses about the origins, pathogenesis, adaptation, spread, persistence, and transmission dynamics of medically important viruses. The battle to control HIV requires the best possible understanding of its current genetic diversity, and such understanding can best be achieved by viewing contemporary gene sequences in the context of historical genetic variation. With just a handful of exceptions, the 'molecular archeology' perspective has to date not been exploited with respect to HIV-1 group M, the focus of this proposal. The overarching aim of this project is to make a comprehensive and integrated effort to understand the future of HIV-1 group M by recovering then analyzing information gleaned from its past. To accomplish this we will aim 1. to use archival specimens from the 1970s to uncover the history of the origin and emergence of HIV-1 in North America; 2. to recover and analyze near- full-length envelope gene and, if possible, genomic HIV-1 sequence from multiple paraffin- embedded tissue samples from the 1960 and perhaps earlier; 3. to investigate the early genetic diversity of HIV-1 group M in central Africa and how it informs understanding of the current genetic diversity in this important region by screening large numbers of archival samples for HIV-1 and conducting sequence and phylogenetic analyses on the resulting data set. Crucially, we have assembled a massive collection of archival specimens, many from sources that have not yet been widely considered in the field of HIV research, with which we will illuminate the remarkably unstudied early phase of HIV evolution (from around the time of the discovery of AIDS, back to 1960s and perhaps even earlier) right up to the present day. Our expertise and track record make us uniquely positioned to conduct this important research.      "
5 R01 AI087139-04,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In many settings in Africa, women with unknown HIV status present late in pregnancy or in labor, and the postpartum period represents a major entry point for counseling, testing, and assessment for antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. ARV use in pregnant and breastfeeding women has clear benefits for mothers and infants. Furthermore, if an infant is already HIV-infected, breastfeeding is seen as posing no risk to the infant, and women are strongly encouraged to continue breastfeeding to maximize survival of the infant. However, use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in breastfeeding women may induce ARV resistance in some HIV-infected infants, either through transfer of ARV-resistant strains from the mother to the infant, or by exposing the infant to biologically significant but sub-therapeutic amounts of ARV drugs, leading to selection of ARV-resistant HIV in infants who are already infected with ARV-susceptible HIV. Development of ARV resistance to more than one class of ARV drugs (multi-class resistance) in HIV-infected infants is likely to significantly reduce their chance of responding to life-saving ARV therapy. The hypothesis of this study is that maternal HAART induces multi-class ARV resistance in the majority of HIV-infected breastfeeding infants. This hypothesis will be tested using samples and data from the Post-Exposure Prophylaxis of Infants (PEPI) trial that was conducted in Blantyre, Malawi. In PEPI, approximately 90 women who initiated HAART postpartum had infants who were HIV-infected. Women and infants in PEPI received ARV drugs for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (pMTCT). Most women (~70%) received single dose nevirapine (sdNVP). All infants received sdNVP and 1 week of zidovudine (control regimen). Infants were then randomized at birth to receive either the control regimen alone, or the control regimen plus up to 14 weeks of extended daily NVP or extended daily NVP plus extended daily ZDV. These regimens were stopped immediately in infants with confirmed HIV infection. Because these pMTCT regimens are known to cause selection of NVP-resistant HIV in some women and some HIV-infected infants, exposure to pMTCT regimens will be considered in our analysis. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: Aim 1: Test whether initiation of maternal HAART postpartum is associated with emergence of multi-class resistance in HIV- infected breastfeeding infants. Aim 2: Analyze HIV viral load, ARV drug levels, and HIV drug resistance in breast milk samples from women on HAART. These studies will quantify the prevalence of multi-class resistance in infant plasma and breast milk after maternal HAART initiation, and will identify factors associated with development of multi-class resistance in HIV-infected breastfeeding infants. These studies will also assess whether infants in this setting are more likely to acquire multi-class resistance from transmission of resistant HIV from the mother (selected from her HAART regimen), or from exposure to ARV drugs in breast milk. This information will facilitate the design and implementation of strategies for HIV prevention and treatment in resource-constrained settings.      "
5 R01 AI087520-04,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV continues to infect human populations worldwide, emphasizing the need for epidemiological tools that can accurately describe transmission patterns. Thus, the methods we will develop will have specific impact on HIV vaccines; evolution; epidemiological parameters: spread of infection in different groups; intervention; and more generally on the fundamental science of infectious diseases. The overall goal is to understand the relationship between virus evolution and its epidemiological history, and to create epidemiological tools that can make reliable contact tracings and assess changes in epidemic dynamics. We have recently shown that the epidemic rate is inversely correlated to the virus evolutionary rate on the population level. Thus, the specific hypothesis behind the proposed research is that there is a relationship between the speed at which an epidemic moves through a human population and the rate at which the virus evolves in that population. We have observed that there are discrepancies between transmission histories and viral phylogenies, and because the inferences of epidemics are based on phylogenetics, it becomes important to understand the limitations in such inferences. Based on this the specific aims of this proposal are to: 1. Create a model that accurately describes the connection between transmission history and viral phylogeny. Preliminary results suggest that there are ""hidden lineages"" in viral phylogenies that are involved in transmission events, potentially misleading reconstruction of transmission events. We will especially investigate the effects of the effective population size in the donor, the bottleneck at transmission, and incomplete lineage sorting during transmission and sampling. We aim to estimate meaningful confidence levels on reconstructed person-to-person transmissions enabling us to explore alternative hypotheses in a statistical framework specifically designed for epidemiological tracking. 2. Identify the mechanism that correlates epidemic rate and virus evolutionary rate. We will decipher the connection between epidemic rate and viral evolutionary rate. Currently, we have four alternative explanations that may cause the observed correlation between epidemic and evolutionary rate (host immune selection, viral generation time effects, selection during transmission, and recombination effects). We will use different gene sequence data, codon positions as well as amino acid signatures to discriminate between these hypothetical explanations. We will use large datasets to develop epidemiological models that include these four hypothetical explanations to investigate their effects on the population level, and also model social networks and epidemic and phylogeographic dynamics.

5 R01 AI094607-03,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa is highest of any global region and many infections occur among youth ages 15-24 years. Comprehensive HIV prevention in high-burden sub-Saharan African settings must address both HIV and pregnancy among young females, and HIV prevention strategies among males, using evidence-based approaches in combination. Settings such as Nyanza Province, western Kenya where there is high HIV prevalence, high fertility rates, early onset of sex, frequent intergenerational sex and low circumcision prevalence are a high priority for developing and evaluating multi-component HIV prevention with a focus on young men and women in order to have a large population impact. Our team of biobehavioral and clinical scientists, mathematical modelers, and trial design specialists will: Identify gender (sex)-specific drivers of HIV acquisition risk, including pregnancy among females, for youth in sub-Saharan Africa, and interventions to best address those risks (Aim 1). Conduct mathematical modeling to select optimal combination intervention package components and to assess potential population-level impact (Aim 2). In partnership with a highly-productive nongovernmental organization (NGO) that is delivering PEPFAR-funded HIV prevention services, develop and pilot a combination HIV prevention package specific for female and for male youth - 'MP3-Youth' - in Migori district, Nyanza Province (Aim 3). We will deliver the MP3-Youth package using community-based mobile health teams with the NGO. All youth attending the mobile health events will complete an audio computer-assisted self-interview survey. A randomly-selected subset of n=200 youth will be followed longitudinally at 6- and 12- months using cell phone text message surveys to prospectively assess prevention method uptake, adherence, and risk compensation behaviors. Design a phase IV study protocol for testing the effectiveness of a gender-specific youth HIV prevention package in sub-Saharan Africa (Aim 4). We will disseminate these research protocol recommendations, and study instruments including the mathematical modeling tool, as a combination prevention intervention research toolkit. The MP3-Youth study will provide critical information for design and evaluation of combination HIV prevention intervention packages that are sensitive to gender-specific risks among this most-at-risk population in high-HIV burden African settings.

5 R01 AI097265-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mucosal transmission of HIV involves a strong bottleneck effect and most often, a single founder virus is transmitted. The relative contributions of stochastic (random) selection vs. active selection by specific viral and host characteristics to this bottleneck are unclear. Mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission (MTCT) through breastfeeding, in which transmission pairs and timing of infant infection are readily identified, provides an instructive model to address these important and unresolved questions. We will use serial samples from a large, well characterized cohort of HIV-1 infected Zimbabwean women who transmitted HIV-1 through breastmilk. This cohort includes women with chronic HIV-1 infection (CI; N=35), and women who acquired primary HIV-1 infection post-partum (acute infection, AI; N=13). We combine phylogenetics (with frequency analyses based on deep sequencing data) with functional assays (CD4 and co-receptor use, entry kinetics, neutralization sensitivity), to quantitatively and comprehensively analyze the relationship of founder viruses to maternal blood or breastmilk variants, quantify the relative contributions of stochastic vs. active selectio, identify selection pressures on envelope (env), differentiate when selection pressures may operate during the transmission bottleneck, and determine whether founder env variants are better adapted than other non- transmitted variants for postnatal MTCT. Delineation of the biologic properties of transmitted variants along with mapping the genetic bases of these biologic properties, should improve understanding of HIV-1 entry and the mechanisms of action of HIV-1 entry inhibitors. These studies will also improve our understanding of the in vivo selective pressures exerted by autologous neutralizing antibodies and innate factors in two distinct and relevant anatomic compartments (blood, where levels of antibodies are high, and breastmilk, where they are much lower) and the potential role of neutralization sensitivity or escape in transmission. Finally, these studies will specifically reveal whether increasing the neutralizing activity of blood or breastmilk (e.g., through passive or active immunization) or targeting other Env functional properties (tropism, infectivity) hold promise to block primary infection of women and children.

5 R01 AI098420-03,"One of the great enduring mysteries in disease ecology is the timing of the AIDS pandemic. AIDS emerged as a clinical entity in the late 1970s, but HIV-1, the retrovirus that causes pandemic AIDS, entered the human population from wild primates many decades earlier, probably near the turn of the 20th century. Where was HIV during this long interval? We propose a novel ecological model for the delayed emergence of AIDS. Conceptually, in a metapopulation consisting of multiple, loosely interconnected sub-populations, a pathogen could persist at low levels indefinitely through a dynamic balance between localized transmission, localized extinction, and long-distance migration between sub-populations. This situation might accurately describe a network of villages in which population sizes are small and rates of migration are low, as would have been the case in Sub-Saharan Africa over a century ago. We will test our model in a highly relevant non-human primate system. In 2009, we documented three simian retroviruses co-circulating in a metapopulation of wild red colobus monkeys (Procolobus rufomitratus) in Kibale National Park, Uganda, where we have conducted research for over two decades. We will collect detailed data on social interactions, demography, health, and infection from animals in a core social group. We will also study a series of 20 red colobus sub-populations, each inhabiting a separate, isolated forest fragment. We will determine the historic connectivity of these sub-populations using a time series of remotely sensed images of forest cover going back to 1955, as well as using population genetic analyses of hypervariable nuclear DNA markers. We will assess the infection status of each animal over time and use viral molecular data to reconstruct transmission pathways. Our transmission models will define the necessary conditions for a retrovirus to persist, but they will not be sufficient to explain why a retrovirus might emerge. This is because human social factors ultimately create the conditions that allow zoonotic diseases to be transmitted from animal reservoirs and to spread. We will therefore conduct an integrated analysis of the root eco-social drivers of human-primate contact and zoonotic transmission in this system. We will study social networks to understand how social resources structure key activities relevant to human-primate contact and zoonotic transmission risk, and we will explore knowledge, beliefs, and perceptions of human-primate contact and disease transmission for a broad sample of the population. We will reconcile perceived risk with actual risk through a linked human health survey and diagnostic testing for zoonotic primate retroviruses. The ultimate product of our research will a data-driven set of transmission models to explain the long-term persistence of retroviruses within a metapopulation of hosts, as well as a linked analysis of how human social factors contribute to zoonotic infection risk in a relevant Sub-Saharan African population. Our study will elucidate not only the origins of HIV/AIDS, but also how early-stage zoonoses in general progress from ""smoldering"" subclinical infections to full-fledged pandemics."
5 R01 CA083679-13,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human papillomaviridae comprise a large family of DNA viruses tropic for mucosal or cutaneous epithelium. Infections by these extremely prevalent pathogens can result in epithelial hyperproliferation, including ano-genital warts and laryngeal papillomas. Infections by the high-risk (HR) mucosal genotypes such as HPV-16 and HPV-18 and closely related types can progress to high grade dysplasias and cancers, notably cervical, penile, anal, and a fraction of head and neck carcinomas. Globally, over 1000 people, primarily women, die each day of HPV diseases. Prophylactic vaccines to HPV-6, -11, -16 and -18 effectively prevent new infections by these four virus types, but there are no therapeutic agents that are consistently efficacious and specific against papillomaviruses. HPVs infect basal keratinocytes, while the productive phase occurs only in the differentiated strata of squamous epithelia. We demonstrated that E7 destabilizes p130 (a member of the pRB family of pocket proteins) in the differentiated keratinocytes, enabling the S phase reentry and progression necessary for viral DNA amplification. The HR HPV E6 is known to degrade the major tumor suppressor p53 and a number of additional host proteins. The transmembrane protein E5 up-regulates the signal transduction of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Thus, HR HPV E7 and E6 together can immortalize primary human keratinocytes (PHKs), and E5 increases the efficiency. But how these E5 and E6 activities are utilized to promote the viral productive program remains elusive. This is because genetic analyses of HR HPVs have been conducted for well over a decade in organotypic raft cultures of immortalized epithelial cells that support viral productive program inefficiently. The limitation is compounded by the inability of E6 mutants to persist in PHKs or to immortalize them. We recently established a simple, effective, and reproducible method to generate HPV genomic plasmids in PHKs by using Cre-loxP mediated excisional recombination in vivo. A robust productive program was recapitulated by the wild type HPV-18 genome in PHK raft cultures, and progeny virions were passaged for the first time in raft cultures of naive PHKs. We validated the utility of our system for HPV genetic analyses by successfully examining an E6 mutant genome, not previously possible. Our results showed that a full-length E6 protein is necessary for efficient viral DNA amplification. Importantly, this approach circumvents the need for the immortalization functions of the HR HPVs or for pre-immortalized epithelial cell lines in order to perform genetic analyses of HPVs in PHK raft cultures. Preliminary studies revealed that E5 is also critical. We have formulated specific hypotheses on the possible roles of E5 and E6 proteins and propose to exploit this PHK raft culture system to test our hypotheses and elucidate their functions in the viral productive program. Complementary genetic and biochemical approaches will be used throughout. With a thorough understanding of the pathways which HPVs dysregulate and to which HPVs are addicted, targets of therapeutic agents will be identified to serve as the foundation for antiviral drug discovery."
5 R01 DA003574-30,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Risk Factors project has studied the very large HIV epidemic among injecting drug users (IDUs) in New York City from 1978 (using stored sera) and the very large HIV epidemic among non-injecting heroin and cocaine drug users (NIDUs) since 1995. In our current research, we have demonstrated a dramatic reduction in HIV transmission among IDUs, but also a substantial increase in HIV among NIDUS. (HIV prevalence has doubled among NIDUs in NYC over the last decade). Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) is strongly associated with HIV transmission, and we have identified prevalence HSV-2 as a major factor associated with HIV transmission among NIDUs in NYC. The specific aims of the proposed research include: 1) Monitoring risk behavior, HIV prevalence and incidence and service utilization in the continuing evolution of the HIV epidemic among NIDUs and IDUs in New York City. 2) Quantifying the long-term population-level relationships between HIV and HSV-2 infections among heroin and cocaine users in NYC, including testing the hypothesis that the strength of the association between HSV-2 and HIV increases over time. Recent intervention studies have dramatically increased the need for understanding HSV-2/HIV relationships. 3) Evaluating effects of the New York City Department of Health (NYC DOH) Condom Social Marketing campaign on sexual risk behaviors and HIV and HSV-2 infection among IDUs and NIDUs in NYC. 4) Monitoring patterns of sexual and injection related HIV transmission among IDUs in NYC. There are many linkages between NIDUs and IDUs in NYC. NIDUs and IDUs are best viewed as linked groups within a single population of heroin and cocaine users in NYC. A thorough understanding of sexual transmission among NIDUs requires an understanding of both injecting and sexual transmission among IDUs in the city. 5) Assess new patterns of racial/ethnic differences in HIV infection among NIDUs and IDUs. 6) Intervention development. These aims will be accomplished through continuation of our studies of NIDUs and IDUs entering Beth Israel drug treatment programs in NYC. The proposed research will be the first study of the spread of HIV over time in a very large population of NIDUs, the first assessment of change in the relationship of HVS-2 to HIV over time among NIDUs, and the first assessment of the effects of a very large condom social marketing campaign on sexual risk behavior of NIDUs and IDUs.

5 R01 DA010767-15,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall purpose of this competing continuation is to expand our understanding of the processes associated with the development of substance use and high-risk sexual behavior from early childhood through emerging adulthood, and the processes leading to addiction and dependence in emerging adulthood. The original study began with the assessment of 1075 youth, their parents and teachers, when youth were in first through fifth grade, enabling a multi-source assessment of etiological factors measured at a young age. Annual assessments across ten years, with minimal attrition, have provided extensive data on over 950 youth, following them until they are in the 10th grade through one year post high-school. Together with the original study, the proposed data collection will extend the follow-up to one-year post high school for all youth, and add an in-depth assessment of all participants when they reach age 20/21 consisting of a diagnostic interview and a social stress test to assess cortisol reactivity. A developmental/contextual framework examining the interaction of etiological factors across four systems, biological, cognitive, personality and social, guides our research questions addressing five aims: (1) Examine the processes explaining continuity and discontinuity of the development of substance use from early childhood through adolescence and into emerging adulthood; (2) Further the understanding of the relation between the development of substance use and at-risk sexual behavior, identifying unique and common predictors; (3) Further the understanding of the relation between childhood stress and stress in emerging adulthood, and substance use and abuse/dependence and high risk sexual behavior; (4) Further the understanding of the relation of substance use to the assumption of ""adult"" roles in emerging adulthood; and (5) Assess the generalizeability of models developed with data from our primarily Caucasian sample by examining the fit of models using data from a sample consisting primarily of African Americans, the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS). Unique novel features of this study include the length of follow-up (first grade to age 21), annual assessments during childhood and adolescence enabling the identification of classes of trajectories, and the integration of psychological with biological variables. The assessment in emerging adulthood of cortisol reactivity, a biological marker of stress associated with substance use and addiction, further expands the etiological framework underpinning this project. The generality and importance of findings from this project will be extended significantly through collaboration with the FACHS by enabling a comparison of etiological processes between African American and primarily Caucasian youth. These findings will guide future prevention and intervention efforts for youth by identifying etiological processes occurring from the early elementary years through emerging adulthood that place individuals at risk or that are protective, including the relation between stress reactivity and addiction.

5 R01 DA012237-13,"Substance misuse is the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in females. Effective  prevention of substance misuse by females, depends, in part on increased understanding of femalespecific  risk and protective factors that influence pathways toward and away from addiction. The main  goal of the proposed research, which directly addresses NIDA strategic priorities in prevention, is to  investigate factors influencing the development of substance use, abuse, and dependence in girls  during a period of peak risk (ages 15-22). This renewal requests continuation of NIDA support for 5  further annual substance use assessments (i.e., Years 11-15) with girls and their parent as a  substudy to the NIMH-funded Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS; N = 2,451; 52% African American, 41%  Caucasian), a longitudinal, population-based study of the development of conduct problems and  depression in four cohorts of girls, initially assessed at ages 5 to 8. The next 5 years, which will cover  ages 15-22 in an accelerated longitudinal design, are critical to understanding factors influencing the  development of substance use and HIV risk behaviors (e.g., risky sexual behavior) during  adolescence and the transition to young adulthood. The proposed project aims to: (1) characterize  trajectories of substance use, abuse, and dependence in girls, starting in childhood, through  adolescence, and into emerging adulthood; (2) examine trajectories of girls substance involvement in  conjunction with the developmental course of psychopathology (e.g., depression) and other problem  behaviors (e.g., risky sexual behavior); (3) determine how proximal and distal risk and protective  factors (both general and female-specific) influence the development of substance involvement in  girls, including analyses of differences by ethnicity; and (4) to simultaneously examine trajectories of  substance use and HIV risk behaviors to determine how these health compromising behaviors  interact over time to influence HIV risk in females. The proposed continuation of 5 annual substance  use assessments, in conjunction with 10 waves of data already collected, will permit the linkage of  childhood factors to substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and emerging  adulthood. The PGS, as one of very few population-based studies of females in the US, is uniquely  suited to addressing gaps in knowledge regarding the ways in which individual, environmental, and  developmental factors interact to influence substance use in a large, urban sample of African  American and Caucasian girls. Study findings will be used to improve substance use and HIV risk  screening, and to guide prevention efforts for females."
5 R01 DA015523-09,"Historically, the majority of people with substance use disorders in the US has been under age 50. This trend is changing as baby boomers with record high prevalence rates of substance disorders, enter their 50s and 60s, and their demand for treatment is expected to double for the second time by 2020. Consequences of addiction and HIV risk behaviors are expected to interact with vulnerabilities associated with natural aging. While rates of long-term recovery increase with age, many will continue to relapse and interact with treatment systems lacking in age-appropriate services. An empirical basis is needed to inform service development and delivery. Few long-term studies of individuals with chronic addiction and treatment histories exist; even fewer elucidate the interface between chronic addiction, HIV risk behaviors and aging. Preliminary analyses from a recent longitudinal study (Scott & Dennis 2009) indicated that among 348 adults who reported multiple sexual partners, 299 (86%) stopped engaging with multiple partners during one or more quarters (over 21 months), but 297 (85%) subsequently re-engaged at some point with multiple partners. Among the 515 adults who reported unprotected sex, 402 (78%) stopped during one or more quarters, but 467 (91%) subsequently re-engaged in unprotected sex. Among the 114 adults who reported needle use, 106 (94%) stopped during one or more quar-ters, with 43 (38%) subsequently reinitiated needle use. Moreover 2/3rds of those engaging in these high-risk behaviors in any given quarter were not immediately willing to enter treatment. Thus, as is the case for sub-stance use in general, this suggests the need to better understand the apparent cyclical nature of HIV risk behaviors over time.  The proposed study targets this gap by capitalizing on a previous NIDA-funded longitudinal study that re-cruited 1,326 people presenting to publicly funded substance abuse treatment between 1996 and 1998 and re-assessed 9 times through 2007 (90%+ retention/wave). The original gender-balanced sample consisted largely of ethnic minority members with chronic histories of polysubstance use including cocaine (64%), alcohol (44%), opioids (41%), or marijuana (14%). At intake, the mean age was 35 years (4% 50+), at 9 years it was 44 (18% 50+), at the start of the proposed study it will be 49 (42% 50+) and at the close 54 (53% 50+). This project will extend the original study by adding annual interviews at 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 years post intake to establish one of the longest and largest treatment cohort studies of its type to date. The cohorts comprehensive history, captured in earlier waves, paired with new prospective information, offers a cost-effective and rare opportunity to identify factors to help minimize the burden of aging on the substance use and heath fields. Study aims are to: 1) Determine if there are age-related changes in the predictive value of factors expected over time to in-crease (including age of first use, number of sober friends, treatment received) and decrease (including severi-ty, mental distress, legal involvement, HIV risk behaviors) the likelihood of initiating/maintaining abstinence over the next 12 months; (2) Determine if there are age-related changes in the predictive value of factors expected over time to increase (e.g., prior abstinence, being female, self-help engagement) and decrease (e.g., number of prior treatment episodes, homelessness, and number of arrests, HIV risk behaviors) the likelihood of maintaining abstinence another 12 months; (3) To test whether there are age-related changes in the predictive value of variables expected over time to decrease (e.g., loss, grief, HIV risk behaviors, functioning, disability) and increase (e.g., activity level, quality of life, social support) the time from 3 years of abstinence to late stage relapse, (4) To evaluate whether there are age-related changes in the impact of the cumulative pattern of re-covery on future critical posit"
5 R01 DA020195-16,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this renewal application is to extend our long-term investigation of intergenerational continuity and discontinuity in drug use in a three-generation prospective design, using data from the Rochester Youth Development Study and the Rochester Intergenerational Study. We examine three general issues: first, we describe intergenerational continuity and discontinuity across the generations for drug use and related problem behaviors, including delinquency, depression, and health-risking sex behaviors for HIV/AIDS; second, we identify mediating and moderating processes to explain both intergenerational continuity and discontinuity in drug use and co-morbid behaviors; third, we examine these intergenerational issues for fathers as well as for mothers. The focal participant is the oldest biological child (G3) of the original participant in the Rochester study. The project proposed here capitalizes on the rich developmental data collected since 1988 on both the parents (G2) and grandparents (G1) of these focal subjects; combining those data with the prospective data collected in this study provides a rare opportunity to examine how the parent's own developmental course influences their transition to adulthood and their behavior as parents which, in turn, can be used to explain the onset and development of the child's drug use and related problem behaviors. In Year 1 (1999) we selected G3 children 2 years of age and older (n=371), and we continue to add new 2-year-olds each year. By Year 12, when current funding ends, we will have a total sample of approximately 520 families and will be 96% of the way towards our sampling goal of all oldest biological G3 children. Annually, we interview the G2 parent, the child's other primary caregiver, and the G3 child (age 8 and older). At earlier ages we videotaped dyadic interactions between the child and each of these caregivers. Data are also collected from teachers, schools, and other agencies. Measures include the parent's structural position and stressors, drug use and problem behaviors, prosocial bonds, peer networks, family context, and parenting behaviors. For G3 we assess their general psychosocial development, including detailed information on the onset and course of their drug use and related problem behaviors. The analysis investigates how G2 drug use and antisocial behavior are related to G3 drug use and antisocial behavior both at the same and at different developmental stages. It then uses the detailed data on G2's life-course development, as well as their current behavior and parenting practices, to identify mediating pathways for intergenerational continuity and sources of resilience for intergenerational discontinuity. The 5-year period proposed here is particularly crucial to the project's aims as it is during these years that the vast majority of the G3 participants will move into and through adolescence when drug use is initiated and maintained and when they overlap in age with their parents when they were assessed in the Rochester study.

5 R01 DA024555-05,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Opioid addiction has remained widespread throughout the United States since the 1960s and a large proportion of users are involved in crimes to support their habits. After release from incarceration, relapse to opioid addiction is very common and this leads to more crimes and re-incarceration. Treatment advances in the area of medications have not reached this population. Effective medications such as methadone and buprenorphine are not well accepted by prosecutors and judges. Permission to conduct research on the most effective treatment approaches is very difficult to obtain for patients under legal restraint because informed consent is problematic. Naltrexone, an opiate receptor antagonist, has demonstrated pharmacological efficacy in preventing relapse to opioid addiction and it has been reported to be clinically effective in parolee populations although it is rarely used. Recently a depot formulation with a one month duration has received FDA approval for the treatment of alcoholism. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a monthly injection of naltrexone is practical and useful in the prevention of relapse and when compared to treatment as usual. We will also monitor HIV risk behaviors to determine whether the intervention reduces risk of HIV and hepatitis C infections. This collaborative project will take place in six treatment sites where there is a large population of parolees with a history of opiate addiction. In order to prevent even a subtle form of coercion, referrals from parole officers will not be accepted. After determining that all volunteers are opiate free by urine test and not currently opiate dependent using a naloxone test, they will be randomized to depot naltrexone or Treatment as Usual (TAU). Participants in both groups will be given identical follow up monthly for six months with measures of opiate use by self-report, urine test and hair analysis. An additional random urine test will take place each month between monthly visits. Both groups will be re-evaluated six and 12 months later. The University of Pennsylvania will be the coordinating site and each site will have a randomization goal of 20 new patients per year over 3.5 to 4 years to accrue a total of 360 to 400 participants. Treatment outcome will be measured by urine tests, hair analysis, self-report and continuation in treatment. Both naltrexone and comparison groups will receive equivalent voucher incentives to remain in the program. A benefit-cost analysis will be conducted to compare the costs of the treatment with the quantifiable benefits in terms of reduced crime, re-incarceration and medical services and increased employment.

5 R01 DA024646-05,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intentional injury (violence) is the leading cause of death among African-American youth. The provision of medical services in an inner-city Emergency Department (ED) provides a critical opportunity to identify and characterize future timing and pattern of service use among youth with drug use, who may be missed in school-based samples, and who may not yet be in the criminal justice system. Health disparities exist in rates of violent injury among inner-city youth, many of whom are African-American, and are mirrored in limited access to substance use treatment services and over representation in the criminal justice system. Currently, there is a paucity of data on the timing, pattern, barriers, and trajectory of youth with multiple risks (illicit drug use and ED visit for acute violent injury) in terms of their intersection with health services (substance use treatment, mental health, medical) and criminal justice system, which limits the development of optimal timing and setting for interventions. Youth treated in the ED may have exacerbated rates of illicit drug use, and other risk behaviors (e.g., delinquency, HIV risk behaviors, weapon carriage) and different trajectories of outcomes and interactions with service use sectors based on presentation for intentional injury as compared to other complaints (medical, unintentional injuries). Understanding the outcomes and service utilization among inner- city youth with drug use with and without acute violent injury is critically important in developing prevention and treatment services to address these multiple risk factors. We propose a prospective observational study over a two-year period to identify a high risk group of youth with past year illicit drug use (N=800) seeking care in an inner city ED. The specific aims of the study, chosen to obtain data necessary to determine the location and content of subsequent interventions, are: (1) To describe characteristics of youth (ages 14-24; n=800) who report illicit drug use presenting to an urban ED for an acute violent injury (n=400), compared to youth with drug use who seek non-violence related ED care (n=400), including socio-demographic characteristics, problem severity (e.g., substance use, violence, HIV risk behaviors, etc.), enabling factors, and service utilization (i.e., substance use treatment, mental health, and medical); (2) To identify the trajectories of participants' interactions with health services during the two years following their ED visit and the key characteristics (i.e., predisposing, enabling, and need factors) associated with types of service use (substance use treatment, mental health, medical/ ED, and HIV testing) and barriers to these services; and, (3) To measure two-year outcomes for this cohort including, HIV risk behaviors, and to identify key socio- demographic and clinical characteristics of youth with drug use, who have poor outcomes in the two years after ED visit for intentional injury and other medical care. The proposed study represents collaboration with an established team of investigators who have a successful history of conducting substance use research in ED settings. There is a critical need to understand who is at greatest risk for poor outcomes (substance use, criminal justice, medical), and, who is least likely to enter treatment in order to target substance use and mental health interventions for those with greatest need. Results from this proposed study are essential to inform future ED prevention and intervention development to reduce health disparities among inner-city youth with substance use. "
5 R01 DA025537-05," PROJECT SUMMARY: Recent trends in U.S. urban centers indicate a rise in the number of new HIV infections in the population of young men who have sex with men (YMSM). These trends suggest a high level of vulnerability to HIV seroconversion in YMSM through sexual behavior as they emerge into adulthood. In addition, acts of sexual risk taking in this population often function synergistically with illicit drug use, and mental health burden. Despite some success with HIV prevention in the MSM population during the last 25 years, these recent patterns suggest that a reexamination of our prevention strategies for this population, especially for YMSM of color, is needed. Given the interplay that exists between unprotected sexual behavior, illicit drug use, and mental health burden, all such efforts must consider how these overlapping epidemics (also known as syndemics) fuel each other in a cohort of YMSM as they emerge into adulthood. Thus, we will we will initiate a prospective longitudinal program of research to follow the development of syndemics in a racially/ethnically and economically diverse cohort of urban HIV-negative YMSM in New York City as they transition from adolescence into young adulthood, and apply, test, and further develop a theory of syndemic production to understand the development of both maladaptive and adaptive behavioral outcomes. Specifically we seek to (1) develop and test theoretically informed measurement models of the covariance of illicit drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden among emergent adult HIV-negative YMSM within and across time, (2) assess whether patterns of behavior are continuous, discontinuous, or some combination of both; (3) delineate the risk and protective bases-physical factors (i.e., pubertal onset, HIV status), relational factors (i.e., family history of psychopathology, current romantic relationships, peer support, and characteristics of residential, social, and sex neighborhoods), and psychosocial factors (i.e., sexual identity, internalized homophobia, hypermasculinity, racial identity, racial devaluation, HIV optimism) that predict the development of syndemics, and (4) determine the extent to which the development of syndemics varies by race/ethnicity, social class, and homelessness/housing stability in a cohort of HIV-negative YMSM. Using multiple measurement modalities, which include biological assays, calendar based methods, and self-reports, we will follow the development of 675, 18-year-old HIV-negative YMSM. Participants will be recruited through venue-based and respondent driven sampling, as they emerge into adulthood, over seven waves of data collection within a 36-month time frame. We will utilize Structural Equation and Latent Growth Curve Analysis to answer our four main research questions."
5 R01 DA026223-05,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this study is to determine ways of reducing injection drug use and the associated injection-related HIV risk behaviors in opioid dependent injection drug users recruited during hospitalization and followed into the community. In the general hospital setting, the prevalence of injection drug use is high, patients who otherwise might not seek care are accessible, and the presence of a drug-related illness can set the stage for patients to be more receptive to interventions (Stein, 1999). Treatment of opioid dependence using pharmacologic interventions to prevent withdrawal, relieve cravings, and block or attenuate the euphoric effects of opioids has recently been enhanced with the adoption of buprenorphine/naloxone (hereafter, buprenorphine) in primary care office-based medical practices. In the proposed randomized clinical trial we will enroll 195 opioid dependent injection drug users (IDUs): A.1 PRIMARY AIMS 1) To determine if buprenorphine, initiated during hospitalization and continued after discharge, will reduce injection drug use compared to a buprenorphine detoxification condition among opioid dependent injection drug users. 2) To determine if buprenorphine, initiated during hospitalization and continued after discharge, will reduce injection-related HIV risk behaviors compared to an in-hospital buprenorphine detoxification condition among opioid dependent injection drug users. A.2. SECONDARY AIMS 1) To determine if the opioid dependent IDUs randomized to the buprenorphine continuity condition will demonstrate reduced incidence of injection-related medical conditions over the six months after hospital discharge compared to the buprenorphine detoxification condition. 2) To determine if the opioid dependent IDUs randomized to the buprenorphine continuity condition will demonstrate reduced emergency department and hospital utilization over the six months after hospital discharge compared to the buprenorphine detoxification condition. We propose that the initiation of buprenorphine therapy can and should begin during hospitalization for a population that might not otherwise seek drug abuse treatment. In addition, we propose that the linkage to maintenance buprenorphine providers after hospital discharge is feasible and important to study. The findings from this clinical trial will have immediate clinical implications for the care of medical inpatients, and will be broadly generalizable to the chronic disease management of opioid dependence across many institutions. If effective, this intervention could lead to the implementation of specific practical strategies with substantial impact on the HIV risk and drug use behaviors in a population with traditionally poor linkage to health care and an enormous burden of illness.

5 R01 DA027194-04,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substance abuse is associated with high costs to individuals and to society but less than one- third of individuals who are drug dependent and 6% of those who abuse drugs ever receives treatment. Screening, a brief intervention and referral for treatment (SBIRT) for substance abuse and deployed in a primary care setting has therapeutic potential but clinicians typically have less than 10 minutes with a patient and must address a range of medical problems. SBIRT, delivered by computer or nurse, would be a strong addition to a primary care clinician's therapeutic armamentarium for substance abusers but these interventions need to be tested against usual care. Women, who have lower rates of substance abuse treatment, typically receive primary medical care in a reproductive health setting. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends universal screening to determine if women abuse substances but, other than for alcohol and tobacco, there are no empirical data to support the effectiveness of this approach. In fact, the astonishing lack of data on SBIRT in primary care setting is noted by the US Preventative Services Task Force, in a 2008 report. We propose a controlled, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial that would compare two SBIRTs, offered either by computer or a trained nurse, to usual care (a control condition). We will recruit 660 women with a range of psychoactive substance use (e.g. tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, alcohol, opiates, prescription drugs) and randomize them to a nurse- administered referral based upon motivation principles, a computer referral based upon motivation principles or brief advice. All subjects will receive a pamphlet with information and resources. Random effects and logistic regression models will be used to estimate group differences in primary drug used, treatment initiation, and treatment attendance among the 3 groups at 1, 3, and 6 months. Random effects models will also be used to test the incremental costs of the computer and nurse administered referrals.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Screening, brief interventions and referral to treatment for substance abuse have therapeutic potential but are understudied in primary care settings, in women and drug users. We propose a pragmatic trial that would randomize 660 women in a reproductive health setting who have a range of psychoactive substance use (e.g. tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, etc.) problems to a nurse-administered referral based upon motivation principles, or a computer referral based upon motivation principles or brief advice (control condition). Costs of the conditions would be estimated to provide models of cost effectiveness.         "
5 R01 DA027772-05," The overall goal of this study is to study the context and epidemiology of HIV, STIs and associated risk behaviors among high risk female sex workers (FSWs) and their non-commercial male partners in two Mexico- US border cities. Preliminary data collected by our binational team over the past 5 years suggest that FSWs' non-commercial partners may be significant drivers of HIV/STI acquisition and/or their re-infection, which is supported by literature in other countries. FSWs in our setting are more than twice as likely to engage in unprotected sex with their main non-commercial partner; half of these partners have concurrent partnerships and one third are IDUs. The proposed study of FSW-partner pairs (dyads) builds on our existing research infrastructure in Tijuana and Cd. Juarez to meet the following aims: Aim 1: To examine the a) context and b) patterns of high risk sexual and substance using behaviors among high risk FSWs and their main non- commercial male partners, both within and outside of the partnerships, using a mixed-methods approach; Aim 2: To determine prevalence of HIV and specific STIs (i.e., syphilis, gonorrhea, Chlamydia, HSV-2) and associated correlates at the individual and partner level; Aim 3: To prospectively identify predictors of STI incidence and their attributable risks at the individual and partner level; Aim 4: To determine the feasibility of conducting a behavioral intervention trial among high risk FSWs and their main non-commercial male partner at the a) partner level and b) individual level, using mixed methods. To meet these aims, we will recruit 100 FSW-partner dyads in both Tijuana and Cd. Juarez (i.e., 200 couples), who will undergo interviews and HIV/STI testing at baseline and follow-up for 24 months to address both clinical and behavioral outcomes (Aims 2 and 3). A subset (25 couples per city) will undergo in-depth interviews at baseline and once during follow-up to refine the quantitative survey, and inform a mixed methods analysis to address Aims 1 and 4. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, we will assess each partner's interest in participating in a subsequent intervention, attrition and partnership dissolution, and potential barriers to interventions such as intimate partner violence (Aim 4). To our knowledge, the proposed study is the first prospective evaluation of FSWs and their non-commercial partners. Our binational research team is uniquely positioned to conduct this study, which will inform the response to the growing HIV crisis on the Mexico-US border and efforts to curtail HIV transmission among FSWs and their partners in other resource-constrained settings."
5 R01 DA027981-04,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed study (R01; PA-07-070) will examine the heterogeneity of victimization, its' relationship with substance use and psychological distress, as well as the combined affect of these factors on the health seeking process among victimized women in the criminal justice (CJ) system. Study aims are to 1) identify and characterize latent class trajectories based on victimization, substance use, and psychological distress among 400 victimized women on probation and parole; 2) determine the extent to which women in the identified trajectory classes vary, over a two year time period, in levels of risk and protection in the health seeking process; and 3) examine the theory based components of the health seeking process among 400 victimized women on probation and parole. Findings from this research will be used to identify those groups of women that are most at risk for engagement in high risk behaviors (current drug use; psychological distress; HIV risk behavior; lawbreaking and continued CJ involvement) and to identify and characterize their associated levels of risk and protection in the health seeking process across a two year time period. Study findings will provide a theoretically guided understanding of the relationship among the component parts of the health seeking process that affect engagement in high risk behavior, over time, among this population. These data are necessary prerequisites to the development of tailored intervention strategies that target specific groups of women within the CJ system; these data can provide practitioners, administrators and policy makers with direct information about which groups of women will be most amenable to which intervention/prevention approaches. Study findings have the potential to have broad relevance within the CJ system and other care systems (e.g. substance abuse and mental health treatment systems) that provide services to this marginalized and growing population.

5 R01 DA028692-04,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is growing recognition of the importance of 'place' on individual risk of disease, although most studies fail to capture the dynamic nature of the risk environment and its effect on the sex trade has been understudied. The Mexico/US border region is undergoing profound alterations in the environment in which sex work takes place, providing a 'natural experiment' through which we can explore the relative contributions of individual and structural factors on HIV transmission. The primary goals of this research are to define social, spatial, and physical factors affecting female sex workers (FSWs) in 2 border cities and determine their relevance to HIV epidemiology, drug use, and access to services. Tijuana and Ciudad (Cd.) Juarez have witnessed escalating community-level violence and, for Cd. Juarez, changes in the location and visibility of the 'red light' district. While migration and cross-border interactions are major influences, the recent global economic downturn is dramatically altering migration patterns. Based on the above, the specific aims of this project are to: 1) assess changes in social influences on the sex work risk environment over time in both cities and their effect on risk behaviors, HIV/STI incidence, and access to services; 2) determine the locations where FSWs live, work and engage in other activities and their relationship to risk behaviors, perceptions of violence, and access to services; and 3) determine the extent to which the built environment and other sex work venue characteristics relate to individual-level behaviors and HIV/STI incidence. To meet these aims, we will recruit 600 FSWs (300 per city) and collect sociodemographic, location, and behavioral data through interviews. All will be tested for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and Chlamydia and treated as needed. Follow-up interviews and testing will occur at months 6, 12, and 18. To meet aim 2, we will construct a geographic information system (GIS) of both cities and explore factors in relation to where FSWs live, work, buy/use drugs, and access services. Changing spatial relationships, such as the dispersal of the Cd. Juarez Zona Roja and intra-urban or cross-border mobility, will be analyzed to track patterns of infectious disease spread. We will also conduct in-depth interviews and an activity-travel survey with 30 sex workers per city, stratified by geography and venue (e.g. street, bar, etc.) to create geo-narratives based on time-geographic methods and computer-aided qualitative data analysis in order to explore the impact of recent social, economic, political, and other structural changes on participants' lives. To meet aim 3, field measurements of the built environment and other venue characteristics will be combined with individual-level data to explore their effect on health outcomes. The data collected will provide information vital to reframing HIV and drug use interventions to take into account the structural environment. This project is timely as HIV prevalence is rising along the U.S./Mexico border, presenting a window of opportunity to prevent transition to a generalized epidemic."
5 R01 DA028763-04,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to address how disproportionate confinement of racial/ethnic minorities-especially African Americans-affects health disparities in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. African Americans comprise only 13% of the general population, but about 40% of incarcerated youth and adults and 50% of new cases of HIV/AIDS. Yet, large multisite national longitudinal studies of HIV/AIDS focus on high- risk samples such as men who have sex with men (MACS), women infected with HIV and other ""at-risk"" females (WIHS), and infected women and their infants (WITS). These studies do not include adolescents, do not sample correctional populations, and do not examine the effect of incarceration on HIV/AIDS. Most studies of incarcerated populations are cross-sectional and provide limited information on the effects of incarceration. To continue to address this key omission in the literature, we propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a longitudinal study of 1829 juvenile justice youth, enrolled at age 10-18 years (1172 males, 657 females; 1005 African Americans, 296 non-Hispanic whites, 524 Hispanics, and 4 ""other"" race/ethnicity). Currently, the HIV/AIDS component of the project (RO1 DA022953) includes only a subsample (n=743) and 10-, 11-, 12-, and 13-year follow-up interviews. We now propose to (1) study the entire sample (originally 1829, now 1678); (2) conduct 3 additional annual interviews (14-, 15-, and 16-year follow-ups), at which time participants will be aged 26-34 years; (3) collect official records to cross-validate self-reported data (on STI status, arrests, incarceration history, and services received); (4) test the entire sample for HIV infection, chlamydia, and gonorrhea; and (5) administer a new module on incarceration, release, and re-entry. Participants are re-interviewed whether they are re-incarcerated or back in the community. Using data collected in prior phases and the additional interviews, we will examine patterns of drug use, drug use disorder, HIV/AIDS risk and infection from adolescence (ages 10-17 years) to emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) and young adulthood (age 25 and older). Our Specific Aims focus on how incarceration, release, and re-entry (e.g., age[s] incarcerated, number of incarcerations, length of incarcerations, amount of time spent in the community between incarcerations) affect the following: (1) drug use behaviors (including the number and types of substances used, frequency of use, and route of administration) and drug use disorders (onset, persistence, desistance, and recurrence); (2) HIV/AIDS sex risk behaviors (including unprotected anal or vaginal receptive sex and trading sex for drugs) and injection-risk behaviors; (3) prevalence and incidence of HIV infection and other STIs; (4) the relationship between patterns of drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, especially how risk and protective factors predict, moderate, and mediate these relationships. This study responds to the initiatives of NIDA, NIAAA, and other NIH institutes to reduce health disparities in HIV/AIDS in minority populations."
5 R01 DA029513-04,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A recent paradigm shift in public housing policy is catalyzing one of the largest planned migrations in US history. Public housing agencies are relocating residents of spatially concentrated complexes to voucher- subsidized rental units in the private market that are geographically dispersed. The HOPE VI policy embodies this paradigm shift, and is relocating 200,000 households from concentrated complexes to rental units in target cities. HOPE VI migrants tend to move to safer, less poor, and less drug-involved neighborhoods (though gains are attenuated for alcohol and other drug [AOD] abusers); at the same time, migrants' social networks and social supports decline. Migrants' neighborhood conditions, networks, and supports may evolve for some time: HOPE VI inaugurates a period of serial moves for 50% of migrants. Most migrants are African-American and all are poor. Rates of AOD abuse and HIV risk are high among these residents before they move. At issue in the proposed study is whether and how HOPE VI relocations, and the changes in migrants' neighborhood conditions, networks, and social supports that these relocations create, shape African-American migrants' AOD abuse and HIV risk. The proposed [4]-year study will have a quasi-experimental pre-/post-exposure design with an unexposed comparison group. The exposed group will consist of [180] migrants from 7 Atlanta Housing Authority (AHA) complexes targeted by HOPE VI; the unexposed comparison group will consist of 150 residents of 6 AHA complexes that are not relocating. All participants will be African-American, and we will seek variation in the sample in baseline AOD abuse status in order to study how AOD abuse shapes trends in outcomes of interest. The proposed multilevel longitudinal study, led by a new investigator, will achieve the following aims: Aim 1: Characterize trends in residential mobility among HOPE VI migrants during the [4]-year the study period; describe changes in the characteristics of the census tracts where migrants live over time (e.g., poverty rates); and learn how AOD abuse status affects these trends. Aim 2: Characterize changes in network and social supports over time in the full sample (N=[330]), and determine how HOPE VI status and AOD abuse status affect these changes. Aim 3: Describe trends in AOD abuse, proximal HIV risk factors, [and HIV incidence] over time in the full sample, and learn how these trends relate to HOPE VI status and AOD abuse status (where AOD abuse trends are not the outcome). Aim 4: Analyze relationships of changes in the characteristics of the census tracts where participants live (Aim 1), and in their networks and supports (Aim 2), to trends in AOD abuse and proximal HIV risk (Aim 3). This study will build on foundations laid by a NIDA R21 study in which we are (1) creating the [330]-member cohort; (2) initiating data collection; and (3) refining retention methods. Results will advance scientific knowledge in NIDA priority areas on migrations, AOD abuse, and HIV, and on determinants of AOD use and HIV among African-Americans.      "
5 R01 DA029899-04,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this study is to explore the context of rising drug use along the Mexico/Guatemala border and define its relationship to the local epidemiology and phylo-geography of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Shifting drug trafficking routes, poor economic conditions, and increasing popularity of hard drugs among youth may be some of the factors driving substance use. Numerous regional and international migrants passing through the area likely contribute to the spread of HIV and STIs. However, data is lacking on the relationship between drug use and HIV/STIs in the region. Based on the above, the specific aims of this project are to: 1) describe the contextual factors affecting drug use and patterns of use in high risk populations along the Mexico/Guatemala border; 2) determine the prevalence and correlates of HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and STIs among substance users; and 3) explore the phylo-geography and molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 infection in at-risk groups. To meet Aim 1, 20 in-depth interviews with a diverse sample of substance users in Tapachula/Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico and 20 in the Teczn Uman/Quetzaltenango area of Guatemala will be conducted to provide contextual data on risk behaviors and help refine study instruments and methods. Additionally, focus groups with substance using men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSW), and migrants, as well as with organizations serving those at-risk for HIV will be conducted. To meet Aim 2, three consecutive cross-sectional cohorts (n=400, 200 on each side of the border) will be recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Face-to-face interviews will collect information on sociodemographics, HIV/STI knowledge, risk behaviors, and access to health services. All will be tested for HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex virus-2, and HCV, and treated as needed. Round 1 will comprise substance using FSWs; Round 2 will focus on the MSM population; and Round 3 will begin with peer recruiters (""seeds"") drawn from ""mobile"" persons- including truck drivers, deportees and regional and international migrants. We anticipate and will be able to measure the overlap between these risk groups. For Aim 3, we will sequence the HIV-1 pol gene, including reverse transcriptase, from those infected with HIV which will enable us to assess if recombinants or drug resistant strains of HIV-1 have emerged in this region and the extent to which there is mixing between at-risk groups. As migration routes have been identified as important corridors of disease transmission in other settings, they may be one of the first places new HIV subtypes will be identified. This project will create and expand ties among investigators in Mexico, Guatemala, and the U.S. and increase regional research capacity. Findings will help inform the development of subsequent HIV interventions and prevention programs that intervene upon risky substance use behaviors before they become further entrenched. Since the HIV epidemic in most of Latin America is still concentrated, there is a critical window of opportunity to prevent transition to a generalized epidemic. "
5 R01 DA030241-04,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cocaine use and its associated risky sexual behaviors (e.g., sex with multiple partners, inconsistent condom use, trading sex for drugs or money) represent a significant contributor to the ongoing spread of HIV. However, little is known about how sex, drugs, and money are valued in this population, nor about the perturbed neural processes mediating these tradeoffs. In this application, we directly address the objective of PAS-07-324 to increase understanding of processes of cocaine addiction that influence decisions about high-risk sexual behavior. We propose to explore this via the convergence of behavioral and neural underpinnings of the pathological decisions made by Chronic Cocaine Users (CCUs) not in treatment using a model-based approach, behavioral decision tasks, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our overall hypothesis is that the processes of addiction result in a dysfunctional decision system that underlies the risky sexual behavior engaged in by CCUs; in other words, CCUs engage in risky sexual behavior because they discount future outcomes as a result of a hypoactive executive system (in prefrontal cortex) and a hyperactive impulsive system (in limbic brain circuits). To improve our understanding of cocaine addiction processes that influence decisions about risky sexual behavior, we will obtain critically needed information about the CCU's valuation of relevant commodities (sex, drugs, money), recognizing that these commodities serve multiple functions and may interact with one another in novel ways. We will study valuation and inter-temporal choice within and across different commodities to gain new insights into the decisions made by CCUs, including decisions closely tied to the high-risk behavior of trading sex for drugs or money, and how they differ from Recreational Cocaine Users (RCUs) and Community Control Participants (CCPs). We hypothesize that different commodities will show different profiles of effect depending on availability of other commodities (same or different commodities), their temporal location (immediate or later), and the subject group (CCUs, RCUs, CCPs). Additionally, given the existing data, we anticipate systematically replicating that the discounting of money (money now vs. later) will be predictive of HIV risk behavior in a new population (CCUs). The inclusion of neural correlates will permit us to identify for the first time the role of different neurobehavioral decision systems in decision making predictive of HIV risk behavior. By comparing money discounting to discounting of drug and sexual activity within and across commodities, we will determine whether novel discounting procedures and associated neural processes are more predictive of risky behavior than money discounting. Completion of this project will provide substantial new information about neural valuation systems that are altered by addiction and lead to risky sexual behavior. Understanding how the commodities of interest interact with one another and the neural systems that participate in that valuation may suggest new approaches to alter the pathologic valuation and impact risky behavior associated with the spread of HIV.

5 R01 DA030351-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fatal overdoses involving pharmaceutical opioids have increased dramatically over the past decade, surpassing those related to heroin, and are the leading cause of drug overdose in much of the U.S.  In Seattle- King County, 75% of drug overdoses involved pharmaceutical opioids and/or heroin in 2009. Opioid overdoses, heroin and pharmaceutical, are preventable and reversible. Recent research suggests that opioid users at risk for overdose have higher rates of HIV risk behaviors. The emergent group of heroin users who were initially dependent on pharmaceutical opioids (39% of heroin users according to a 2011 Seattle survey) has significantly lower HIV risk perceptions and HIV testing rates. Research indicates that drug users and their partners can be successfully trained to recognize and reverse overdoses with naloxone. Despite active heroin overdose prevention and intervention programs with naloxone (OOPIN) in 15 states with thousands of overdose reversals and no serious adverse events, rigorous studies of these programs on rates of subsequent heroin overdoses have not been conducted. No OOPIN programs or studies have yet been implemented for pharmaceutical opioid users at elevated risk for overdose. The Emergency Department (ED) setting holds great promise for identifying and recruiting those at elevated risk of heroin and pharmaceutical opioid overdose: 1) the ED study site for this proposal provides most services to those needing care for acute opioid related medical problems in Seattle, and 2) patients need for urgent medical attention may heighten their concern about potential harms from opioids. Unique to this setting is the potential to identify high risk pharmaceutical opioid users. ED interventions using brief behavior change counseling (BBCC) have been shown to significantly improve health behaviors such as alcohol use and injury, to increase entry into drug treatment as well as to reduce costs. Evidence is promising, but limited, regarding the impact of BBCC on opioid related risk behaviors. This prospective, randomized ED trial will study the effectiveness of an intervention that combines OOPIN with BBCC for both heroin users (n=500) and pharmaceutical opioid users at elevated risk for overdose (n=500). The primary outcome is subsequent opioid overdoses, ascertained by follow up interviews conducted at 3, 6 and 12 months as well as via administrative records for up to 24 months (i.e. medical records, ambulance responses, and death certificates). Hypotheses to be investigated include that the intervention recipients will have: 1) lower rates of opioid overdose, 2) reduced drug use and overdose risk behaviors, 3) more appropriate health care utilization, and 4) lower total health care costs. We will also determine the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors and the impact of the intervention on these behaviors. Excellent data systems and several features of clinical practice and policy make Seattle the ideal place to conduct this research. The study team is uniquely qualified to conduct this study and will be adapting interventions with which they have years of research and clinical experience.    "
5 R01 DA031056-03,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding of the spectrum of the HIV and HCV epidemics in injection drug users (IDU) has been advanced by a number of outstanding prospective studies conducted in various part of the world, including, North America, Europe, and Australia. Each of these studies has furthered our understanding of disease prevalence and incidence, risk behaviors, and natural history, including clinical, immunological and virological factors. This application seeks funding for the first global collaboration of prospective studies of HIV and HCV in IDU. The ""International Collaboration of Incident HIV and HCV in Injecting Cohorts"" (InC3), is merged international multi-cohort project of pooled biological and behavioral data from nine prospective cohorts of IDU. The InC3 collaboration will facilitate new in-depth studies of HIV and HCV infection not possible from each individual study. This collaboration will allow us to study 4,091 IDU who have been followed for a collective 9,016 person-years of observation, 859 incident HCV infections with longitudinal follow up, and 575 HIV infections. This proposal includes six research questions that represent some, but not all, of the potential breadth and depth of the proposed InC3 research collaboration, including: assessment of temporal trends in HIV and HCV incidence, examination of HCV incidence by HIV status and sexual behavior, estimates of rates and determinants of HCV viral clearance and reinfection, examination of the effects of HCV infection disclosure are on risk behaviors, and an evaluation of outcomes related to clinical treatment of acute HCV in IDU. Many of these questions remain unanswered due to the relatively small number of small numbers of behavioral, viral, or clinical events in each study. However, since many have been meticulously characterized in each of these rich longitudinal cohorts, merging data will offer the statistical power needed to make firm conclusions. The significant and innovative scientific agenda and the InC3 leadership will be supported by an administrative core and Data Coordinating Center (DCC). InC3 will promote and support the development of new study questions and research opportunities through supporting research exchange and training for participating junior scientists. Lastly, some gaps in biological data will be addressed with support for laboratory measures from stored specimens. This proposed InC3 study, will accomplish the following: (1) creation of a rich new data source that will fill scientific knowledge gaps that heretofore have not been possible in single studies alone; (2) enable new research relevant to understanding, preventing, and treating HIV and HCV in IDU; (3) the creation of a multilateral collaborative of researchers and scientists committed to long term cooperation and partnership in areas including: epidemiology, behavioral studies, clinical research, and laboratory science. Many of the investigators of this proposed multicenter project are experienced and successful in pooling and analyzing large epidemiological data in both a national, and international, context. Despite the obvious benefits to public health, such an organized effort has never been attempted with cohorts that have studied both HIV and HCV. InC3 is significant, innovative, will advance research relevant to the global burden, consequences, prevention, and treatment of HIV and HCV infections among IDU.      "
5 R01 DA031074-03,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed 5-year epidemiologic study is to assess the impact of Mexico's new drug laws on behaviors and disease incidence among injection drug users (IDUs) in the U.S. In August, 2009, Mexico enacted a controversial law decriminalizing possession of personal-sized quantities of drugs including heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and cannabis. The sister-cities of San Diego, CA, USA and Tijuana, BC, Mexico share the world's busiest land border crossing and are home to nearly 4 million residents. Through research collaborations with the University of California, San Diego and partners in Tijuana, we found: i) increasing drug use and HIV prevalence in Tijuana; ii) dramatically higher prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and M. tuberculosis (Mtb) infections among IDUs in Tijuana versus San Diego; and, iii) injecting in Mexico reported by 21% of IDUs in San Diego. ""Drug tourism"" to Mexico among San Diegan IDUs may be an unintended consequence of Mexico's relaxed drug laws and could increase their risk for HCV, Mtb and HIV infections. This epidemiologic study aims to: 1) identify sociodemographic, behavioral, and health status differences between IDUs in San Diego who do and do not inject in Mexico; 2) describe changes in San Diegan IDUs' knowledge, attitudes, and experiences related to Mexican drug policies and assess their influences on decisions about injecting in Mexico; and 3) determine whether San Diegan IDUs who inject in Mexico are at increased risk for incident HCV and Mtb infection and identify risk factors for infection. To achieve these aims, we will use a mixed-methods design involving quantitative and qualitative data collection. Quantitative methods include recruiting a cohort of 750 IDUs in San Diego via respondent driven sampling for semi-annual behavioral assessments and serologic testing for HIV, HCV, and Mtb infections over 24 months of follow-up. HIV and HCV antibody testing will be performed on serum using standard practices; Mtb infection will be detected by QuantiFERON TB-Gold assay. Qualitative methods involve selecting 20 participants after each assessment visit (total=100) for in-depth interviews that will be used to: i) explore novel findings that emerge in preliminary analysis of the quantitative data; ii) identify new areas of inquiry for addition to the quantitative assessments; and iii) assess the validity of quantitative findings by presenting them for interpretation to study participants in qualitative interviews. The iterative process of using qualitative and quantitative data to inform methods and interpret findings of each approach facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the conceptual model describing how Mexico's new law will impact the behaviors and health outcomes of IDUs in San Diego. This study meets NIDA priorities supporting epidemiologic research on HIV/AIDS co-morbidities including HCV and tuberculosis, and the prevention of HIV among vulnerable populations. This study exploits a rare natural experiment to evaluate the impact of opposing drug policies on interconnected, bordering communities, and will provide important insights for future policies.

5 R01 DA031189-02,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to contribute to the prevention of three interrelated, harmful and costly behaviors that peak in early adulthood: drug abuse, HIV/AIDS-related sexual risk behaviors and intimate partner violence (IPV). The project builds on the 20-year multisite prospective Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN). LONGSCAN includes structured interviews with high-risk youth and their primary caregivers every two years from age 4 through 18 and regular review of Child Protective Services records with detailed coding of child and adolescent maltreatment (CM). The proposed study aims to add a wave of data collection when participants are between 22 and 25 years old. The specific aims are to: 1) examine the impact of CM and related risk factors on age of drug use onset, trajectories of use, and Substance Use Disorders (SUD); 2) test the independent and combined effects of CM, related risk factors, and drug use on HIV/AIDS-related sexual risk behavior and IPV; 3) test the independent and combined effects of CM, drug use, related risk factors, and mutable protective factors on early adult resilience across multiple domains; and 4) test innovative models of the long-term patterns of neglectful parenting and their impact on drug outcomes, sexual risk behavior and IPV. Neglect is by far the most prevalent form of CM and the most strongly associated with parental drug abuse of any CM type, yet also the most understudied regarding its long-term course and effects on drug use. Predictive models will include tests of potential moderation by three risk factors (violence exposure, maternal depression, and parental, family, and peer drug use) and three protective factors (maternal emotional support, positive father involvement, and caregiver stability). Hypotheses for each aim will be tested using general growth mixture models, structural equation models, latent class models, and tests of model invariance. By analyzing rich multi-informant data across 14 years of childhood and adolescence to predict the development of early adult SUD, sexual risk behavior, IPV, and resilience in a high-risk sample, the proposed project will substantially enhance the empirical foundation for the development of prevention, services, and policies targeting drug abuse and related health risk behaviors. This project will increase our knowledge of the development of three major public health problems following CM: drug abuse, sexual risk behavior, and IPV. By assessing maltreated and high-risk youth who have been followed since age four as they transition to adulthood, this study will identify key risk and protective factors, and the ages at which they are most influential. Results will inform prevention, treatment and policy.      "
5 R01 DA031785-03,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Substance use disorders among criminal offenders present a unique challenge to criminal justice and public health systems. These systems must balance punishment and rehabilitation while simultaneously dealing with addiction - a chronic, cyclical, and multidimensional disease that is pervasive among criminal offenders and requires long-term monitoring and extended care protocols (McLellan et al., 2000; Scott et al., 2003). Women offenders, approximately 70% of whom have substance dependence or abuse issues (BJS, 2002), are of particular concern from economic, clinical, and criminal justice perspectives as they represent the fastest growing subgroup in local jails (BJS, 2003). Women offenders are also more likely to have co-occurring mental health problems that further complicate their rehabilitation and recovery process upon reentering society (CASA, 2010). Moreover, the social and economic implications of addiction and criminality extend to the children of women offenders.  The need to address substance use within the women offender population has generated interest in Recovery Management Checkups (RMCs), an evidence-based approach to promoting long-term recovery that provides clients with periodic monitoring, feedback, and linkage with treatment as needed. The Recovery Management Checkups for Women Offenders (RMC-WO) intervention is currently testing the long-term effectiveness of the RMC model with a group of women offenders coming out of jail. These interventions are designed to reduce substance use, HIV-risk behaviors, and criminal recidivism. Very little economic research has been conducted on community re-entry and long term monitoring models for women offenders that have the potential to improve long-term outcomes and lower total costs to society. In response to the pressing need for economic evaluations of RMCs, the proposed research project will estimate the costs, cost effectiveness, and net benefits of RMC-WO relative to a control condition. The specific aims of this research are as follows:  1. Estimate the economic cost (total and per client) of the RMC-WO intervention.  2. Estimate the cost effectiveness of RMC-WO relative to the control group over the three-year follow-up  period for core outcomes (substance use, HIV risk behaviors, illegal activity) and ancillary outcomes  (treatment engagement and treatment retention).  3. Obtain or derive appropriate monetary conversion factors and estimate the economic benefits of RMC-  WO relative to the control group over the three-year follow-up period to form benefit-cost ratios and net  benefit estimates.  Successfully fulfilling these aims will not only advance scientific knowledge of the overall impact of addiction interventions for women offenders but also improve clinical practice by increasing our understanding of the financial considerations of implementing RMC-WO on a broader scale.

5 R01 DA031816-03,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With over 15 million past month users, marijuana is the most widely used illicit substance in the United States. This is concerning because marijuana use is associated with multiple outcomes such as accidents, aggression, risky sex that leads to HIV and school dropout. However, marijuana may also have some therapeutic effects and fourteen states have legalized medical marijuana. Colorado now has an estimated 100,000 medical marijuana patients, and this widespread use raises concerns about marijuana abuse, diversion and other consequences of use. Unfortunately, there are few data describing the impact of medical marijuana legalization. The Specific Aims and hypotheses of this proposed 5-year R01 study are: 1. During Phase I we will determine how the evolving medical marijuana industry operates from the perspective of consumers, MMC owners and prescribing physicians, as well as ascertain the views of drug treatment and health care providers concerning how medical marijuana impacts their responsibilities. As this Phase is designed to gather information to inform Phase III, there are no hypotheses. 2. In Phase II we will conduct an ongoing assessment of the epidemiology of medical marijuana, including change in the number of consumers and MMCs and consumers' and physicians' reasons for medical marijuana. Hypothesis 2: The increase in medical marijuana availability will lead to an increase in the prevalence of marijuana use and marijuana-related problems. 3. In Phase III we will assess the prevalence of marijuana abuse and dependence, diversion, other drug use, general health and health care utilization among medical and non-medical marijuana users. Hypothesis 3a: At baseline, there will be fewer medical marijuana users with cannabis dependence and they will have lower rates of other drug use and health problems than non-medical marijuana users. Hypothesis 3b: Over time, increase in rates of cannabis dependence, other drug use and health problems will be greater for medical marijuana users than non-medical marijuana users. Hypothesis 3c: Among medical marijuana users, there will be an increase in the diversion of medical marijuana over time. 4. Also in Phase III we will assess HIV-related sex risk behaviors among medical and non-medical marijuana users. Hypothesis 4a: At baseline, fewer medical marijuana users will report HIV sex-related risk behaviors than non-medical marijuana users. Hypothesis 4b: Over time, medical marijuana users will increase their engagement in HIV related sex-related risk behaviors more than non-medical marijuana users.      "
5 R01 DA032639-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unlike traditional studies of drug use which have focused either on individuals or communities, our study examines how focus on micro geographic drug hot spots adds to our understanding of drug use and related health problems. The specific aims of the project are: 1) to compare health outcomes (including mental and physical health, drug use, HIV and STI risk) and antisocial behavior of residents who live in drug hot spots to residents in predatory crime hot spots and non-hot spot places; 2) to identify developmental patterns of health outcomes and anti-social behavior of individuals, and the relationship of those patterns to social and ecological changes in characteristics of places; 3) to measure how social and ecological characteristics of places are related to drug hot spots as compared with the comparison conditions; and 4) to identify (and compare) predictors of developmental trends in health outcomes, drug use and other anti-social behaviors over time in the three study samples. This study would provide significant new knowledge about the causes of drug use and its relationship to health outcomes, including mental and physical health and HIV and STI risk. Such knowledge would lay the foundation for the development of new and innovative intervention strategies that recognize the importance of micro geographic mechanisms in the production of drug use, and related anti- social behavior and health problems.  In order to address these issues, a prospective longitudinal study of 450 street segments in Baltimore City, Maryland over a five year period is proposed. The sampling approach involves the selection of 150 ""drug hotspots"" as characterized by official data from the Baltimore City Police Department (BPD), and comparison samples of 150 ""predatory crime hot spots"" and 150 ""non-hot spot"" street segments. These street segments would be drawn randomly from eligible units in the city, and will be selected so as to minimize possible spatial contamination. Four types of data collection will be used to address the research goals of the study: 1) an innovative panel survey (with replacement) conducted three times over a five year period at the street segment level, comprising 4,500 completed surveys per wave; 2) physical observations of characteristics of the street segments conducted simultaneously with the surveys; 3) a qualitative study of a sample of 50 street segments from each of the three study groups; and 4) archival data on characteristics of street segments. Analytic methods in the study include descriptive comparisons of the three groups, hierarchical linear models, longitudinal regression designs, and trajectory analysis.        "
5 R01 DA032678-03,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): State laws that allow medical marijuana use, including the Michigan Medical Marihuana Program (MMMP), create policy tension due to a paucity of scientific data about factors that influence: marijuana use patterns, abuse potential, decisions to seek/renew medical certification, impact of marijuana use on HIV risk behaviors, and health outcomes. This proposal will address these knowledge gaps by studying marijuana-using persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs) in Michigan's largest HIV primary care clinic (Detroit, 1700 patients) with a prospective mixed-method approach, as described in these Specific Aims: Aim 1. In 120 marijuana-using PLWHAs (certified medical users, non-certified therapeutic users, and recreational users; 40/group), we will (A) use behavioral economic simulations to evaluate marijuana demand sensitivity to experimental manipulation of unit price and income; and (B) determine whether marijuana price elasticity, cross-price elasticity with other drugs/therapies, and income elasticity differ across marijuana user groups. Aim 2. In a subset of 36 marijuana-using PLWHAs (certified medical, non-certified therapeutic, and recreational users; 12/group from Aim 1), conduct a laboratory-based, double blind, placebo-controlled, marijuana smoking evaluation (cumulative 0, 4, 8 and 12 puffs from 3.5% delta 9-THC cigarettes). We will (A) determine whether marijuana dose-effect profiles for symptom relief and abuse liability differ between marijuana-using groups; (B) compare smoked marijuana demand across groups; and (C) compare intensity of experimental (""gold standard"") and naturalistic smoking effects. Aim 3. In the same 120 marijuana-using PLWHAs as Aim 1, use chart review, urinalysis, and interviews to measure prospectively at baseline, and at quarterly intervals for one year, clinical factors that are hypothesized to influence marijuana use and medical certification: socioeconomic changes, physical and mental health, substance use, criminal justice involvement, acute care utilization, HIV risk-transmission behaviors, and reasons for marijuana use. We will use clinical data alone and combined with simulated marijuana demand (Aim 1) and smoked marijuana responses (Aim 2) to predict longitudinal patterns of marijuana and alternative therapy use. Aim 4. Determine whether prevalence of certified medical marijuana use, non-certified therapeutic use, and recreational use in the 120-patient prospective sample generalizes to the entire HIV clinic. We will survey a random sample of 300 PLWHAs to (A) determine whether marijuana use patterns are representative within this large urban clinic located in the area with disproportionally high HIV prevalence, and (B) compare characteristics of this sample to prior cross-sectional survey data. At the conclusion of this project, we anticipate that (1) these data will reveal distinct patterns within this population; (2) we will have achieved a more sophisticated understanding of medical marijuana use, and (3) we will be able to predict which subsets of HIV patients are likely to benefit or be harmed. These findings will be disseminated to patients, providers and society to promote public health and informed policy debate.      "
5 R01 DA033862-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this time-sensitive application is to measure the effectiveness of the new abuse deterrent formulation (ADF) for OxyContin(R) in decreasing abuse of OxyContin(R). Prescription opioid abuse is a major public health concern and has plagued the rural United States in particular. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and the FDA have strongly encouraged the pharmaceutical industry to develop formulations that protect against abuse; however, apart from clinical trials among pain patients demonstrating efficacy of the drug for treating pain, there have been no epidemiologic studies to date that have examined whether ADFs are actually effective in reducing abuse of any drug. A longitudinal epidemiologic study of prescription opioid abuse is currently in the latter phase of follow-up in rural Kentucky (R01-DA024598) in which 94.8% of participants abused OxyContin(R) in their lifetime, and 81% abused the drug in the 6-months prior to the formulation change. Given this high prevalence of OxyContin(R) abuse before the formulation change, this study sample is ideal for detecting changes in signals of abuse with the new ADF for OxyContin(R). The specific aims include: 1) evaluation of the effectiveness of the ADF for OxyContin(R) in reducing abuse via oral, intranasal and injection routes; 2) determining whether opioid users transitioned to abuse of other prescription opioids once the non-ADF version was no longer available on the street; and 3) examination of changes in prevalence and incidence of HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) as a result of changes in route of administration after the old formulation was no longer available. This time-sensitive study is highly significant given the paucity of epidemiologic data related to the effectiveness of ADFs in reducing abuse of prescription opioids. Further, this study is uniquely positioned to measure the effectiveness of the ADF for OxyContin(R) expeditiously and without the potential bias that would result if abuse were assessed retrospectively. Given the importance that the ONDCP and the FDA have placed on further development of ADFs for prescription opioids, the results from this study have vast implications for public policy in addition to public health. This highly relevant study will evaluae the effectiveness of a model ADF across multiple public health domains, including changes in this product's abuse and misuse via the oral, intranasal and injection routes of administration. The results from this study, in turn, will have vast implications for not only public health, but aso policies surrounding development of ADFs in order to prevent abuse of prescription opioids.

5 R01 HD057614-05,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In resource poor regions of the world where HIV is endemic, especially countries in sub-Saharan Africa, nutrition plays a critical role in HIV disease. Nutrition affects the health of HIV-infected women and children, and may influence the risk of mother to infant transmission of HIV through breast milk. Nutrition influences the risk of tuberculosis (TB) and TB disease severity. Existing research has focused on the role of micronutrients in HIV disease outcomes but has not addressed the role of protein calorie supplementation (PCS) in subpopulations of patients with HIV disease at high risk, specifically; HIV-infected women who are either breast feeding or have active TB. Our hypotheses are that administration of a culturally acceptable PCS is a practical, sustainable and effective strategy to: 1) decrease HIV viral load in plasma and breast milk of breast feeding women, enhance passively transferred immune mediators in breast milk, and improve HIV outcomes in women and their breast-fed infants and, 2) decrease HIV viral load, enhance TB-specific T cell immunity, and improve outcomes in women with HIV and active TB. Our two specific aims are to show that these strategies are effective in randomized clinical trials. Drawing on the 8 year DarDar collaboration between Dartmouth and Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences in Tanzania we will conduct 3 nutritional studies among HIV-infected women in Dar es Salaam. Study A will enroll 160 HIV+ and HIV- women who are either  breast feeding (BF) or have active TB to conduct dietary interviews and focus groups to quantitate existing  nutritional deficiencies and to define a culturally acceptable PCS. Studies B (118 HIV+ and 60 HIV- women who are breastfeeding) and C (118 HIV+ and 60 HIV- women with active TB) are randomized controlled trials which will compare the effects of 6 months of PCS + micronutrient supplement (MNS) vs. MNS alone on overall disease outcomes as well as specific surrogate markers of HIV disease, specific immune factors in breast milk and specific T cell responses against TB. Findings from these studies are expected to have a major impact on policies for nutritionally vulnerable HIV subpopulations.          "
5 R01 HD071804-03,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple models indicate that contraceptive use for prevention of unplanned pregnancy is the most cost- effective way to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV. Though multiple contraceptive methods are available to HIV-positive women, method discontinuation and unintended pregnancy are common events. Further, data have emerged suggesting systemic hormonal methods may accelerate HIV disease progression and increase transmission to male partners. In South Africa, HIV prevalence among reproductive-aged women is high (17%) and contraceptive use rates over a 12 month period are low (29/100 woman-years). The levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG IUD) is a long-acting, highly effective contraceptive method with largely localized hormonal effects, 10-log lower serum progestin concentrations than available systemic hormonal methods, and high uptake and continuation rates in diverse settings among HIV-negative women. Preliminary data from 277 HIV-positive women in Cape Town indicate that, though 37% were aware of IUDs, 75% were willing to consider the IUD for contraception following information about IUDs. Expanding method choice may increase coverage and a low-cost LNG IUD is likely to become available in the next few years. Thus, we propose a randomized clinical trial in Cape Town, South Africa with 320 HIV-positive ART-nave (CD4>500) women enrolled in a 1:1 ratio to Intervention (LNG IUD) and Control (copper T380 IUD) arms and followed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months to determine comparative safety and acceptability of the LNG IUD. Participants and outcome assessors will be blinded to treatment arm. We will compare the study arms to address three specific aims: 1) To assess LNG IUD safety through comparative impact of low exogenous progestin exposure on HIV progression markers, including plasma viral load (VL) and CD4 change, and eligibility for ART initiation, or other health status indicators, including sexually-transmitted infection incidence; 2) To measure LNG IUD safety with respect to genital HIV-1 RNA shedding, a surrogate for transmission, measured with genital tract VL; and 3) To measure LNG IUD acceptability by comparing IUD continuation, pregnancy, and expulsion rates between study arms. We will also measure bleeding changes and method satisfaction using qualitative and quantitative measures for participants in each arm, a novel design aspect. This study will inform international medical guidelines to definitively establish LNG IUD safety with regard to HIV progression and transmission, which is of great importance as systemic hormonal methods may become contraindicated due to adverse effects on HIV transmission and progression. The potential impact through subsequent introduction of this highly effective and long-acting contraceptive would be significant reduction of unplanned pregnancy and mother-to-child transmission of HIV, an NIH Office of AIDS Research priority for 2011, and provision of non- contraceptive benefits, such as reduction of anemia, to HIV-positive women in Sub-Saharan Africa.

5 R01 HD072693-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The female genital tract is a gateway to HIV-1 infection and presents multiple potential anatomically distinct sites for HIV-1 transmission. In pre-menopausal women, fluctuating levels of endogenous reproductive hormones during the menstrual cycle induce morphological, immunological and proteomic changes in all compartments of the genital tract. More than 300 million women regulate fertility by hormonal contraception. Upon reaching menopause, some women begin exogenous hormone treatment to alleviate symptoms of vaginal atrophy. The impact of endogenous/exogenous reproductive hormones on HIV-1 acquisition in women is unknown. The unifying hypothesis of this proposal is that reproductive hormones alter HIV-1 acquisition risk by impacting host factors that regulate HIV-1 entry into the cervicovaginal tract and replication in mucosal CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophages. We propose the following specific aims. (Aim 1) To quantify the effect of exogenous and endogenous reproductive hormones on HIV-1 susceptibility of the reproductive tract, (Aim 2) To determine whether reproductive hormones alter the mechanisms responsible for HIV-1 transmission through cervicovaginal epithelia, (Aim 3) To quantify the effect of reproductive hormones on HIV-1 dependency factors in the female genital tract. We will assemble a longitudinal cohort of healthy pre- and post-menopausal HIV-1 uninfected women. Subjects will undergo serial cervical and vaginal biopsy during different phases of the menstrual cycle, before/after starting hormonal contraception (high dose oral contraceptives vs. low dose oral contraceptives vs. DMPA) and before/after starting estrogenic creams. Tissues will be placed in organ culture and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection will be quantified and correlated to n vivo conditions of hormonal pressure. Given that the overriding emphasis of this RFA is on whether reproductive health serves as a co-morbid condition for HIV- 1, it is critical to determine whether the hormonal environment that acts as a master regulator of the female reproductive tract truly impacts HIV-1 acquisition.

5 R01 MH096642-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. They are often referred to collectively as a high-risk group, but this generalization belies the fact that there is a high degree of heterogeneity of HIV risk within the population. Certain socio-ecological factors place some MSM at higher risk for HIV. There are a number of potential drivers of the HIV epidemic, including substance use, undiagnosed infections and high number of sexual partners. However, these broad categories need refinement in order to identify transmission patterns, as it remains unclear which drivers are contributing to the epidemic with HIV transmission as the biological outcome. Real-time identification of epidemiological hot spots, pinpointing the chains of viral transmission and biologically linking drivers of the epidemic are needed to effectively target prevention strategies and interrupt these chains of HIV transmission. Increasing use of antiretroviral (ARV) resistance testing in response to revised clinical guidelines has enriched the availability of viral sequences to study HIV transmission epidemiology. DNA sequencing can be used to establish epidemiological linkages between infected persons. Such linkages are referred to as HIV transmission clusters, comprised of cases whose viruses share sufficient phylogenetic similarities to suggest a recent common source of infection or participation in linked chains of transmission. Identifying clusters that account for the largest proportion of onward transmissions and characterizing the structural, behavioral and biological correlates that predict transmissibility would inform the development of targeted interventions. The proposed study will use a combination of biological, epidemiological, behavioral and psychosocial research tools to obtain an innovative perspective on the HIV epidemic among MSM. The specific aims are: 1) to characterize HIV transmission clusters and correlates associated with transmission; 2) to evaluate the relative impact of acute, recent and long-term HIV infections on transmission clusters; and 3) to assess HIV transmission cluster patterns in relation to attempted risk reduction strategies. We are poised to analyze viral sequences to elucidate the key patterns of HIV transmission. We will enhance the utility of existing data by creating a population-based, analytical database that will harmonize an urban area's HIV/AIDS case registry with viral resistance and sexually transmitted diseases databases. Qualitative interviews will be conducted to describe the psychosocial and behavioral contexts at the level of the transmission cluster to complement the phylogenetic data. Using an adapted Social Ecological model as a conceptual framework, the interviews will elicit seroconversion narratives and obtain detailed data on any specific strategies attempted to prevent HIV transmission. Real-time analysis of HIV transmission cluster data will place us on the leading edge of the epidemic and enable assessment of how high-risk clusters and current prevention strategies affect transmission patterns.

5 R01 NR012150-04,"DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The HIV contraction rate for Latina women in the U.S. is six times the rate for non-Latina, White women. Latinas are suffering disparate negative consequences from substance use disorders, including intimate partner violence, incarceration, homelessness, and medical ailments. Our long-term goal is to reduce the incidence of HIV and substance abuse related health disparities among Latinas. The objective of this application, which is a significant step in pursuit of this goal, is to determine how substance use (both licit and illicit) and HIV risk behavior trajectories of a community-based sample of Latina mothers and daughters are influenced by changes in familial mechanisms (mother-daughter acoplamiento or attachment), cultural processes, and other social determinants of substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors over time. The study design involves four waves of data collection. Baseline data were collected in a cross-sectional pilot study of intergenerational drug use and HIV risk behaviors among Latina mothers and daughters funded by NIDA (R24DA014260, PI: Mario De La Rosa, Ph.D.). Three new longitudinal assessments are proposed to follow-up on baseline assessment. The first new follow-up assessment will be spaced approximately 5 years from the original study's baseline assessment. The remaining two follow-up assessments will occur 1 year from the preceding follow-up assessment. Our first aim is to determine the influence of cultural and social determinants on trajectories of change for substance use and HIV risk behaviors among a community-based sample of Latina mothers and daughters. The working hypothesis is that Latina mothers and daughters who experience (1) more acculturation to U.S. culture; (2) poorer socioeconomic conditions; (3) a loss of interpersonal supports; (4) less religious involvement; (5) involvement with the criminal justice system; (6) intimate partner violence; (7) greater employment, relationship, and/or residential related chronic stress; or (8) declining mental health and medical status since their baseline assessment will exhibit either an increase in or maintenance of high rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors over the 7 year assessment time period. Our second aim is to determine the influence of mother-daughter attachment on trajectories of change for substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Latina mothers and daughters who either increase their levels of attachment or maintain consistently high levels of attachment will report reduced or consistently lower levels of substance use and HIV risk behaviors over a 7 year time period. Our third aim is to determine the moderating role of mother-daughter attachment on associations between experiences of detrimental social determinants and trajectories of change for substance use and HIV risk behaviors."
5 R01 NS063897-05,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the introduction of highly-active antiretroviral treatment (HAART), the proportion of newly HIV-1 infected patients developing HIV-associated dementia (HAD) is increasing. Currently, there is no effective therapy for HAD. Understanding the evolutionary factors driving the emergence of neurovirulent strains during disease progression is of pivotal importance to develop a realistic model of neuroAIDS. The objectives of the current proposal are to define viral evolutionary steps within the central nervous system (CNS) and select monocyte/macrophages from bone marrow, gut, lung and blood preceding and associated with the onset of neuropathogenesis. The Rhesus macaque model of neuroAIDS will be employed to study the evolution of the viral quasispecies during disease progression and to track SIV-infected macrophage subsets infiltrating the brain. 24 animals will be infected with a genetically-defined viral swarm. Peripheral blood and tissue samples will be collected over time and used for amplification of a 3.3kb fragment, including gp160, nef and 5' LTR, of the viral genome, as well as some full-length genomes from selected tissues. We will use laser-captured microscopy to isolate viral variants from specific productively infected macrophage in the brain at early and end stage disease. High-resolution phylogenetic, population genetics, and molecular clock algorithms (phylodynamics) will reveal genetic aspects of viral reservoirs linked to the onset of a neuropathogenic infection that have not yet been characterized because of ethical problems associated with tissue sampling in humans. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the evolutionary dynamics of SIV in lymphoid and non- lymphoid tissues during the course of the infection via longitudinal PBMC/tissue macrophages sampling and brain biopsies of monkeys with and without CD8+ T-cell depletion; Specific Aim 2 will identify macrophage subsets involved in brain entry and acting as potential viral reservoirs for brain infection. We will be able to identify tempo and mode of brain infection and evolutionary signatures leading to the emergence of infectious macrophage-tropic quasispecies that could be used to predict and monitor the disease. Equally important is the possibility to use the findings into developing drugs that target macrophage and viral quasispecies associated to neuropathogenesis. Overall, we will compile the most comprehensive database of longitudinal SIV sequences from a variety of tissues to date. The PI, although a new investigator without previous R01 funding, has significant experience in cutting-edge analysis of genetic data, and has assembled a unique and qualified interdisciplinary team to assist in the study.

5 R03 DA033828-02,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Scope of Work Problem: South Africa, particularly the Western Cape, has experienced a dramatic rise in methamphetamine use over the past decade and also has the largest number of HIV-infected individuals (5.3 million) of any country in the world. It is feared that methamphetamine use may further fuel this HIV epidemic because of its association with risky sexual behaviors. Despite widespread concern about methamphetamine, there has been limited research examining the intersection of the methamphetamine and HIV epidemics in South Africa. Aims: The primary purpose of this exploratory study is to characterize the patterns and severity of drug use among methamphetamine users in Cape Town, and to identify the multiple levels of influence on HIV sexual risk behavior in this population (Aims 1 and 2). We will apply Ecological Systems Theory, which views behavior as reciprocally influenced by factors from the individual, social, environmental, and community levels, as an organizing framework for this research. A secondary purpose is to test the feasibility of using respondent driven sampling (RDS) to recruit methamphetamine users for future HIV prevention studies (Aim 3). Method: Following a phase of formative research to inform the recruitment strategy and pilot test the assessment battery, we will use a chain referral approach to enroll a convenience sample of 160 male and female methamphetamine users from a township in Cape Town for a multi-method study. All participants will complete a quantitative survey that assesses patterns of methamphetamine use and history of substance abuse treatment; rates of sexual risk behavior and use of HIV-related services; and correlates of sexual risk behavior at multiple levels of influence. A sub-sample of 30 participants will be selected for in-depth qualitative interviews to explore patterns of methamphetamine use, progression from casual use to addiction, and the social context of drug use; how methamphetamine use contributes to sexual risk behavior; and barriers and facilitators to drug cessation and treatment, safer sex practices, and HIV testing. Finally, we will test the feasibility of using RDS to enroll methamphetamine users in Cape Town into future HIV prevention research by conducting formative research to determine the suitability and acceptability of this recruitment method and to calibrate the method for this population, and by analyzing the chain referral data to determine whether RDS requirements are met. Significance: This timely proposal, among the first to target methamphetamine users in South Africa, will advance the field of HIV prevention by examining how methamphetamine use may contribute to HIV sexual risk behavior in a sample of non-injecting and primarily heterosexual drug users. The goal of the proposed research is to identify key factors that will inform the development of integrative prevention interventions to reduce methamphetamine use and sexual risk behaviors in the population.

5 R03 DA033906-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) have an alarming HIV/AIDS prevalence and are also one of the only risk groups showing an increasing rate of infections. Network research is a current priority area due to HIV's high transmission dependence on sexual and drug network dynamics; however, few studies have examined the networks of YMSM. In order to advance knowledge of the drug and sexual networks of YMSM and how these networks influence HIV transmission, this study proposes to construct and analyze a macro- network of YMSM by utilizing data already being collected within two NIDA-funded parent studies. These two studies have gathered a sample of 175 YMSM and are investigating their drug, sex, and social networks, and are also collecting data on the prevalence, developmental trajectories, and predictors of HIV and multiple psychosocial health issues linked to the disease (syndemic outcomes). Although these studies are an important first step, the network data collected is ego-centric (or personal network) in nature. While ego-centric data can contribute to understanding the relationships individuals have within their personal networks and possible influence on HIV, many network measures cannot be accurately assessed with ego-centric data (i.e., distance, centrality, positional equivalence). Additionally, ego-centric data may be biased as particular network members (alters) may appear many times across ego-centric networks. And finally, disease spread between networks cannot be measured. This study is a two-phase project that proposes to link the previously collected ego-centric networks of these YMSM by matching the already collected identifying information of alters and building a macro-network of YMSM. A network such as this has never been collected with YMSM, and will lead to new and important analyses. We will create these links using probabilistic matching software. Phase 1 of the project will focus on the construction of the macro-network of YMSM. Phase 2 of the project will analyze the macro-network with the following sub-aims: A) Examine the macro-network structure of YMSM and determine how these network structures differ by individual characteristics; B) Analyze HIV transmission and behavior contagion (e.g. the spread of condom and drug use); C) Identify the key individuals within the macro-network (bridge drug- and sex-network individuals) and those who may hold the most influence (high centrality social- network individuals); D) To describe overlap in drug use and HIV risk behaviors within the macro-network; and, finally E) To examine the value of macro-network structures in the prediction of syndemic outcomes.

5 R21 AI098497-02,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many men who have sex with men (MSM) choose their sex partners, selectively use condoms or alter their sexual repertoire based on a partner's or potential partner's HIV status. How these seroadaptive behaviors affect a man's risk for acquiring HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases (STD) is unknown. Some data suggest that selectively engaging in unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) based on partners concordant HIV status (selective UAI) offers men partial protection from HIV acquisition, but these data are based on subjects' reports of their sexual behavior. However, decisions to seroadapt are only one factor affecting sexual behavior, and knowing if seroadaptation is protective requires actually measuring its impact. We will conduct cognitive interviews to refine a data collection instrument on seroadaption, and then integrate that instrument into a computer assisted self-interview (CASI) currently used by all STD clinic patients in Seattle, WA. The CASI will collect data on seroadaptive behaviors from consenting MSM. We will measure the association of respondents' seroadaptive decisions with their sexual behavior, and hypothesize that these outcomes will be highly associated, but that agreement between them will only be moderate (kappa=0.41-.6), confirming the need to measure seroadaptation when studying MSM's behavioral prevention strategies. Analyzes will use generalized estimating equations to evaluate the association of seroadaptive behaviors with HIV and STI outcomes. We hypothesize that: 1) selective UAI will be associated with a lower risk of HIV among MSM overall, but an elevated risk of HIV compared to consistent condom use or not having anal sex; 2) selective UAI with primary partners will be associated with a lower risk of HIV than selective UAI with casual or nonprimary partners; 3) selective condom use for receptive UAI will be associated with a higher risk of HIV than consistent condoms use, but a decreased HIV risk after controlling for selective partnership formation and selective engagement in anal (vs. oral or manual) sex; 4) the majority of MSM with newly diagnosed HIV will report selective UAI, and 5) selective UAI will be associated with an elevated risk of syphilis or urethral/rectal gonorrhea or chlamydia among HIV infected MSM.

5 R21 DA033131-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Up to five million people per day may use khat, a plant native to East Africa abused for its amphetamine- like effects. In Ethiopia, community surveys found >30% were khat users; studies have reported rates almost double that for persons living with HIV. Focus groups and key informant interviews conducted by Dr. Lifson and colleagues suggest use of khat is a risk factor for default from HIV care, but there no quantitative studies evaluating this association. Ethiopian studies report that only 75% of those started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are retained in care after one year, with losses greatest i the first six months. Inability to retain HIV patients in care undermines medical and public health benefits of global initiatives to identify HIV patients and enroll them in treatment. This exploratory R21 grant will allow us to evaluate this understudied area among both ART and pre-ART patients who are newly enrolled in care, the groups at highest risk for short-term HIV treatment default. Among HIV-positive persons newly enrolled in HIV medical care, we will: evaluate the prevalence and characterize use of khat and other substances of abuse; analyze demographic, behavioral and clinical factors associated with khat use; evaluate the association between use of khat and retention in HIV care; and identify other factors (including use of other drugs) associated with retention in HIV care  500 HIV-positive adults newly enrolled for medical care will be recruited from two major HIV Clinics in Bahir Dar, and will receive a baseline and 6-month follow-up health survey including: demographic characteristics; khat, alcohol and other drug use; HIV knowledge; quality of life; attitudes about HIV status and internalized stigma; social support; and perceived barriers to medical care. Every 6 months, additional data collected from the HIV Clinic will include body mass index, WHO clinical stage, CD4+ count, and dates of all HIV Clinic visits.  Analysis of predictors of current khat use will include demographics, clinial status, and survey responses, with multivariate analyses to identify factors independently associated with khat use. We will also evaluate the correlation between khat and use of other drugs (including alcohol). Retention in HIV care will be defined based upon the fraction of all patients initiating care who continue to be alive and access HIV care according to defined follow-up criteria for ART and pre-ART patients. Our primary hypothesis is that current use of khat is associated with poorer retention in care. Proportional hazards models will be used to estimate associations between covariates and retention, and multivariate models use to identify independent predictors of retention, and to see if there is an association between retention and khat after adjustment for potential confounders.  Our plan as a follow-up to this R21 study is to implement and evaluate an intervention to prevent HIV treatment default, including programs to specifically address khat using HIV patients. Data from this study will be used to develop community interventions that contain education, patient support, and motivational counseling. This research will provide us with a solid evidence base on which to build such an intervention.        "
5 R21 HD074462-02,"     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Family planning services, including hormone contraceptives, are critical for HIV-infected women, in whom prevention of unintended pregnancy not only decreases maternal and child mortality, but also reduces the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission. Similarly, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a lifesaving intervention tha improves the health and economic status of HIV-infected women throughout the world. Therefore, it is of significant public health importance to guide the appropriate use these essential medications. To this end, millions of HIV-infected women in low and middle income countries (LMIC) currently use or are gaining access to subdermal progestin-containing implants as a preferred method of long-acting reversible contraception. These implants are often combined with ART despite the lack of critically needed pharmacokinetic (PK) drug- interaction data to inform their safe and effective concomitant use. Highlighting this concern are several case reports of unintended pregnancy that occurred in patients with subdermal progestin-containing implants concurrently receiving non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART, the most commonly used ART in LMICs. While NNRTIs are known to significantly decrease oral pill progestin concentrations, no data are available to inform healthcare providers of the impact of NNRTIs on progestin concentrations following release from subdermal implants. To fill this critical gap in knowledge, the overall aim of this proposal i to conduct a PK study to evaluate the combination of a levonorgestrel (LNG) implant and NNRTI (nevirapine or efavirenz)-based ART in HIV-infected Ugandan women. We hypothesize that lower LNG concentrations will be observed in patients on NNRTI-based ART and although the implant's efficacy may be retained initialy, this negative interaction will jeopardize implant effectiveness near the end of its intended duration of use (4 years). The specific aims of this project are (1) to characterize the PK of LNG released from a subdermal implant over one year in HIV-infected women with and without NNRTI-based ART and (2) to evaluate the potential for a bidirectional drug-interaction resulting from the long-term impact of chronic progestin exposure on antiretroviral concentrations. To achieve these aims, we will enroll 20 HIV-infected women into each of three study groups: a control group not receiving ART and two treatment arms consisting of patients receiving nevirapine- or efavirenz- based ART. Using sparse PK sampling strategies, LNG, nevirapine or efavirenz concentrations will be measured over one-year and compared between and within groups, as appropriate. The LNG data will also be used to develop a PK model that will predict LNG disposition over the following three years of intended use, allowing for identification of the safe duration of LNG implant use in women on NNRTI-based ART. At the conclusion of this project, the first evidence-based medical knowledge will be available to guide the safe and effective concomitant use of subdermal LNG implants and NRTIs, thereby improving management of reproductive health in millions of HIV-infected women worldwide.

5 R21 NR013628-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early knowledge of HIV status is critical to prevent transmission to others, to link those who are HIV positive to medical care and services that can reduce morbidity and mortality and improve quality of life, and to reduce health care expenditure. Consistently, the National HIV/AIDS strategy has established a goal of increasing the awareness of HIV status in Americans from 79% to 90% in the next four years. The proposed research is in direct response to PA-11-119, ""HIV/AIDS Testing and Follow-up Among the Underserved in the United States,"" and proposes to investigate the acceptability, feasibility, and initial efficacy of a rapid HIV testing and counseling protocol in residents of domestic violence shelters. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pervasive public health problem, and a growing body of research highlights the association between IPV and HIV/STI risk (e.g., increased unprotected sexual occasions, sex with risky partners, trading sex, multiple partners). Further, IPV is associated with many barriers to receiving adequate health care (e.g., transport difficulties, child care needs, safety issues, lack of health insurance). Domestic shelters present an opportune setting for providing health care services for women, providing a safe and supportive environment for testing, while addressing many of the barriers to testing and linkage to care faced by shelter residents. RESPECT-2 is an evidence- based CDC Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interventions (DEBI), utilizing a client-focused, interactive HIV risk reduction counseling model delivered in conjunction with rapid testing. Residents of domestic shelters, however, face distinct HIV risk factors, such as difficulty in negotiating condom use out of fear of retaliation from their abuser, and thus needs to be tailored to meet the specific needs of shelter residents. Thus, in the proposed exploratory/developmental research plan, we aim to expand RESPECT-2 for our target population (i.e., RESPECT-IPV), and to collect preliminary data on RESPECT-IPV + rapid testing's feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy in a sample of 100 high-risk shelter women. Predictors of acceptability (e.g., PTSD symptoms, substance use, IPV severity, prior testing history, HIV knowledge, HIV risk behavior, HIV anxiety, stage of change) will also be explored. Our primary hypotheses are that RESPECT-IPV will be associated with reduced unprotected vaginal or anal sex occasions at 1-week and 3-months post-shelter and fewer cases of vaginal trichomoniasis 3-months after leaving shelter.

5 R25 DA013582-13," ABSTRACT The treatment of patients with drug abuse is limited by a shortage of physicians qualified to conduct clinical addiction research and trained to translate research advances into practice. Both generalist physicians and infectious disease subspecialists, who provide care for patients with HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) infections lack expertise in addiction medicine. These workforce gaps limit the advancement, translation, and dissemination of drug abuse research. This renewal grant - led by established physician-researchers at Boston Medical Center and the Boston University School of Medicine - will advance the Clinical Addiction Research and Education (CARE) Program, which has successfully fostered physician development in addiction research and education over the past 9 years. The CARE Program will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1. To carry out an Immersion Training in Addiction Medicine in order to:  a. Train Chief Resident (CR) educators and their faculty mentors to teach state-of-the-art clinical  care of patients with substance use by hosting the Chief Resident Immersion Training (CRIT) to  build addiction medicine clinical skills including identification, assessment and management of drug and  unhealthy alcohol use; CRIT will also highlight clinical research careers focused on drug abuse.  b. Prepare fellows from Infectious Disease (ID) or other subspecialty programs training in HIV/HCV  to incorporate drug abuse issues into research, teaching and clinical practice by hosting a Fellow  Immersion Training (FIT), which will run in collaboration with CRIT; fellows will have additional focused  exposure to clinical addiction research by CARE Program faculty. 2. To support medical trainees and early career physician faculty in the development of clinical  research careers in drug abuse by recruiting medical students, residents, fellows and junior faculty to be  mentored by CARE Program faculty on drug abuse research projects. 3. To support physicians and drug abuse researchers to be current on clinically relevant drug abuse  research and research ethics including advances related to HIV and HCV by expanding on the  website and research summary newsletter Alcohol, Other Drugs and Health: Current Evidence. The CARE program is a comprehensive effort to train a spectrum of physicians-in-training (i.e, from medical students to junior faculty) in clinical research methods, pharmacologic advances, medical complications, and other dimensions of care of patients with or at risk for drug abuse and dependence."
5 R36 DA034543-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-medical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD), i.e. opioids, tranquilizers, or stimulants, is a serious and growing public health problem in the U.S. Most data on NMUPD among young adults is limited to the heterosexual college population while significant knowledge gaps exist regarding NMUPD among young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Given the well-established intersection of drug use and risky sexual behaviors and high rates of HIV infections in YMSM, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between these drugs and physical, sexual and psychological health of YMSM. YMSM have unique concerns for health risks, such as depression, suicide, bullying, victimization, homelessness, and homophobia, but little is known of their intersection with NMUPD. Many YMSM experience normative pressures that encourage risky behaviors. At the same time, some forms of social support and resilience may buffer against negative effects of stressors. Significant gaps exist in our understanding of how these factors relate to problematic patterns of NMUPD, and whether they modify engagement in risky sexual behaviors. The objective of this study is to contribute directly to our understanding of the social factors that influence NMUPD and risky sexual behaviors among YMSM. The long-term goal of the study is to guide public health practitioners towards developing strategies that will prevent negative effects of NMUPD on YMSM, including reducing disparities in rates of HIV infection among YMSM. The study will investigate the central hypothesis of a deleterious relationship between NMUPD and physical, sexual, and psychological health of YMSM. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1: Determine patterns of NMUPD and risky sexual behavior among YMSM in Philadelphia; Aim 2: Determine the risk and protective factors contributing to NMUPD and risky sexual behavior among YMSM; Aim 3: Explore the social contexts of NMPUD. Aims 1 and 2 will be addressed by recruiting 190 YMSM ages 18-29 in Philadelphia who have recently misused prescription drugs. Aim 3 will be addressed by selecting a subsample of 25 YMSM for a qualitative study. This approach is innovative because it utilizes a conceptual framework that combines a minority stress model and theories of social norms, social support, and resilience; it focuses on a critical cohort of under-researched, hard-to-reach population; and it employs two research methodologies. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance and expand our understanding of the effects of an emerging phenomena (i.e., prescription drug misuse) on adverse consequences of sexual activity. It will also contribute to a better understanding of the role of social determinants on dug use and risky sexual behavior. Such knowledge may inform the development of evidence-based strategies that will prevent adverse health and psychological effects of NMUPD on YMSM and their communities in Philadelphia and elsewhere in the U.S.        "
5 R36 DA035109-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Methamphetamine (meth) use and binge drinking (defined for men as drinking five or more drinks on one occasion) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The economic cost of meth use and binge drinking in the US exceeds $23 and $170 billion, respectively. Among MSM, meth use and binge drinking are up to 20 and 3.5 times more prevalent than in the general U.S. adult population, respectively. Moreover, these two substances are consistently associated with unprotected sex and HIV seroconversion among MSM, who comprise over half of the new infections in the U.S. Thus, effective interventions to reduce meth use and binge drinking may also function as an important HIV prevention strategy by reducing substance-related HIV risk behavior. Naltrexone, a u-opioid receptor antagonist, is a promising agent for meth-using and binge-drinking MSM. Naltrexone has shown efficacy in reducing relapse to amphetamines and is FDA-approved for alcohol dependence. Oral naltrexone is inexpensive and has few toxicities but the standard daily regimen for naltrexone is problematic as patients forget to take the medication. Given the challenges in daily dosing, alternate regimen schedules have been proposed to increase efficacy and expand the population that may benefit. One approach is intermittent targeted administration of naltrexone, whereby individuals take the medication as needed in anticipation of substance use or during periods of craving. Administration of naltrexone prior to exposure to amphetamines significantly attenuates craving and targeted naltrexone has shown efficacy in reducing heavy alcohol use. However, there have been no studies assessing intermittent targeted dosing of naltrexone among meth-using and binge-drinking MSM. Polysubstance use patterns are common among MSM-studies among those who take more than one substance are urgently needed. The aims of this study are to determine whether targeted dosing of naltrexone is feasible, tolerable and acceptable among non-dependent meth-using and binge-drinking MSM. Design: This is a pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of targeted oral naltrexone. Thirty non-dependent, episodic meth-using and binge-drinking MSM will be randomly assigned to receive 8 weeks of naltrexone 50 mg or placebo, to be taken on an as-needed basis to attenuate meth craving or reduce binge drinking. Participants will be seen bi-weekly to receive study drug and substance use counseling. Safety assessments and behavioral surveys will be completed at bi-weekly and monthly visits. Feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability (Specific Aims 1-3) will be assessed with enrollment and retention rates, frequency of adverse events, participant evaluation of targeted dosing and medication adherence. Meth use and drinking outcomes will be assessed via daily text messages and bi-weekly timeline follow-back (Exploratory Aims). Sexual behaviors will be assessed via monthly surveys (Exploratory Aims). GEE logistic models will be used compare the proportions of MSM taking medication during periods of meth craving and binge drinking. GEE binomial and negative binomial models will be used to assess treatment effects on meth use, drinking and sexual behavior.        "
5 R37 AI038518-19,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV prevention efforts, including vaccine, microbicide and co-infection prophylaxis strategies, have yielded disappointing results, highlighting the need for new concepts. To this end, a better understanding of early events in HIV infection, including HIV acquisition in the face of an existing HIV infection (superinfection) are needed. Superinfection, in particular, offers an opportunity to examine immune correlates of protection based on responses to the initial infection. Our research team is in unique position to address such questions because we have developed and maintained a cohort of ~ 2000 women at high-risk of HIV infection for the past 15 years. This cohort includes more than 300 women who have known dates of HIV infection and who have been followed closely, including regular sample collection for a median of 4.4 years after their infection. Importantly, 12 cases of superinfection were identified in the first 56 women examined in this cohort, including both intra and intersubtype re-infections. Here we propose to continue monitoring this unique cohort and leveraging existing samples to examine factors that influence early virus control and the incidence of superinfection and its correlates. Specifically, we propose to examine the role of early humoral immune responses, particularly antibodies that contribute to Fc-mediated antibody activity, in viral control and disease progression. We propose to examine the role of these same immune parameters in cases of superinfection to determine if there are deficits in humoral immunity in those who become superinfected. A major emphasis of our studies will be in determining whether a first HIV infection provides any protection from a second infection by determining if the incidence of superinfection is lower that the incidence of initial infection. We propose to examine whether there are cases of transient superinfection, and if so, whether antibody responses may play a role in viral control in this setting. Together, these studies will provide critical data on the role of Fc-mediated antibody activity in defining early virus control and subsequent disease as well as their potential role in protection from infection.

5 R37 DA019829-08,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competing renewal proposes to evaluate the impact of recent Mexican drug policy reform on HIV-associated risk factors and protective factors among injection drug users (IDUs) in Tijuana, Mexico. In Aug/2009, Mexico approved a law that partially deregulates possession of small, specified amounts of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana for personal use. The law specifies that after this law is enacted in Aug/2010, police apprehending persons who possess sub-threshold amounts of any of these drugs will be released with a record noting that they received 'no penal action'; however, upon a third apprehension, they will be required to enter drug treatment, or go to jail. States are required to have completed drug treatment expansion by Aug/2012. The law has been met with praise and sharp criticism about potential unintended consequences. Our binational research team, which has conducted studies among IDUs in Tijuana for 6 years, proposes a longitudinal, mixed methods study to address the impact of Mexican drug policy reform on the following outcomes among IDUs in Tijuana: 1) Changes in knowledge, attitudes and experiences about the new law and their relationship to drug using behaviors and treatment readiness; 2) Temporal trends in drug use behaviors: i) frequency of injection, cessation and relapse; ii) possession and use of specific drugs and combinations; iii) involvement in gangs and drug economy; 3) Health risks and protective behaviors: i) injecting in shooting galleries and public spaces, ii) receptive needle sharing, iii) NEP and pharmacy attendance, iv) prevalence and incidence of overdose, HIV infection and death; 4) Experiences with drug treatment: i) proportion of drug users over time choosing treatment over incarceration; ii) incidence and experiences with voluntary and court-mandated drug treatment; 5) Law enforcement practices and interactions with IDUs: i) rates of arrest and incarceration; ii) perceived reasons vs. recorded reasons for arrest and incarceration; ii) experiences of cohort participants with police, including corruption and abuse. We will recruit a cohort of 750 HIV-negative IDUs through respondent driven sampling who will undergo semi- annual quantitative interviews and HIV tests. At each visit, a sub-sample who receive citations for drug possession-- especially those entering drug treatment involuntarily -- will be selected to undergo qualitative in- depth interviews to provide context on their knowledge of the law (Aim 1), experiences with drug treatment (Aim 4) and police (Aim 5). Administrative records from drug treatment programs, the police department and jails/prisons will be obtained to serve as independent outcome measures and assess city-level trends. Apart from Mexico, other Latin American countries and elsewhere are adopting more relaxed drug policy reforms. Given Mexico's important role in production and trafficking of illicit drugs, and Tijuana's location as a major corridor through which illicit drugs enter the U.S., this study represents an unprecedented natural experiment, allowing us to evaluate impacts of relaxed drug policy reforms on drug use, treatment, and HIV risk behaviors.

5 R56 DA004334-27,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) represent a marginalized population with substantial disparities in health care access and outcomes. With improved survival due to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV has transformed into a chronic disease. In addition to HIV disease, IDUs also suffer from a syndemic of other chronic diseases including substance abuse, mental health disorders, and non-AIDS comorbidities. Proposed is a continuation of the ALIVE cohort study, among the largest, longest-running and productive IDU cohorts worldwide, and which has followed disadvantaged, primarily African American IDUs in Baltimore, MD since 1988. With advancing age and multimorbidity, the comprehensiveness of care will increasingly determine HIV-infected IDUs quality and quantity of life. We hypothesize that the key determinants of optimal HIV care (e.g., active drug use, provider relationships, social networks, neighborhood factors) may also determine effective comprehensive care for HIV-infected IDUs. While this cohort has and continues to be a platform for an array of studies all critical to addressing questions about the long-term course and consequences of HIV disease and its treatment among IDUs, this proposal emphasizes: 1) improved identification of HIV-infected IDUs most likely to respond optimally to ART. We will examine longitudinal trajectories of drug use and HIV RNA to define membership in optimal vs. sub-optimal response groups, and then quantitatively identify behavioral and clinical correlates and qualitatively examine barriers and coping mechanisms which underlie the ability to optimally respond. 2) To investigate the determinants and consequences of comprehensive care for HIV-infected IDUs from patient, clinical and societal perspectives. Comprehensive care for HIV-infected IDUs extends beyond HIV-focused aspects to include care for chronic comorbid diseases, substance abuse, and mental health conditions. We propose a framework that considers measures of effective comprehensive care from patient (perceived effectiveness), clinical (adherence to quality care indicators) and societal (service utilization) points of view. Building on prior investigation of individual-, provider-, and neighborhood-level factors associated with HAART effectiveness, we will identify determinants of quality comprehensive care. Extending our multi-level framework in this proposal, we will also evaluate the role of social networks (e.g. 'care-engaged' network members) on comprehensive care. Finally, we examine comprehensive care effectiveness in relation to patient-reported (quality-of-life), clinica (multimorbidity, physical performance) and societal (QALYs) outcomes. To achieve these aims, we continue biannual visits with interview, exam, and biospecimen collection supplemented by medical record review and registry linkage. The ALIVE study remains well-positioned to address the emerging issues confronting the healthy aging of HIV-infected IDUs, namely optimizing long-term ART and enhancing comprehensiveness of care.

5 T32 DA023356-07,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Funding is requested to renew a training program that aims to train the next generation of behavioral scientists with expertise in the prevention of HIV and related co-morbidities (i.e. TB, viral hepatitis and STls) among substance using populations. Our program builds upon the joint doctoral programs (JDP) in public health and clinical psychology offered through a longstanding partnership between the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and the San Diego State University (SDSU) Graduate School of Public Health and School of Social Work. In this renewal, a new JDP beginning in 2013 on Social Sciences Research in Substance Abuse will further enhance our applicant pool, and our extended focus beyond HIV co-infections to consider co-morbidities reflects additional breadth. Our objectives are: 1) To provide opportunities for interdisciplinary research training experiences for predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows in epidemiology, health behavior and psychology who wish to focus on prevention research at the intersection between substance abuse and HIV and related co-morbidities; 2) To offer students hands-on experience in the prevention of HIV and related co-morbidities in international settings; 3) To recruit and train researchers from diverse academic backgrounds and under-represented minority (URM) populations with state-of-the-art skills to address challenges in substance use and HIV prevention research; and 4) To train individuals in the responsible conduct of research with human subjects, especially in international and cross-cultural settings. After 4 years of support, our program has supported 16 trainees. Of the 6 postdoctoral fellows and 3 predoctoral trainees who completed training, all remain active in the field; 4 completed Fellows are now Assistant Professors. Three Fellows successfully competed for K01s; one predoctoral trainee received an R36 dissertation grant and a second was granted a Diversity Supplement. We have supported 5 URM, of whom 3 already completed training. Collectively, trainees published 59 manuscripts during their training. We request support for 3 predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral trainees, mentored by 17 Core Faculty. Depending on their level of training, mentees are required to complete courses in substance abuse and infectious diseases, instruction in responsible conduct of research, quarterly cultural sensitivity training workshops, monthly 'Work In Progress' seminars and a grant-writing seminar. Our active research programs in nearby Mexico and 8 other countries create the opportunity for unique, hands-on international training experiences and an infrastructure for trainees to develop into independent investigators.

5 U01 AA020799-03,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV infects over 50,000 new people each year in the US. An important reason why HIV transmission persists is not because of an absence of potentially effective interventions, but rather because effective interventions are often not implemented. To address this problem, we have created a proposal that integrates comparative effectiveness research (which compares the effectiveness of different interventions) and operations research (which compares alternative portfolios of interventions, rather than comparing single interventions in isolation). We place particular emphasis on alcohol because it is a common modifiable risk factor for HIV transmission and is a common modifiable risk factor for HIV progression. Because unsafe alcohol use often occurs together with multi-substance use (MSU) and depression, because they often act on similar pathways to impact HIV transmission, our proposal considers portfolios of interventions that can address these oft-intertwined behaviors simultaneously or in a sequenced, prioritized progression. We also consider intervention designs that can be further tailored based on individual patient characteristics such as age and comorbidity burden. We seek to implement this operations research model within an interactive web-based laboratory that aims to improve research methods by encouraging greater ""cross-talk"" between modeling, observational data analysis, and trial design; and by identify patient groups that may particularly benefit from interventions, or tailoring results to the needs of particular stakeholders.       "
5 U01 AA020802-03,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hazardous alcohol use is prevalent among HIV infected individuals, and is associated with decreased antiretroviral therapy uptake, adherence, and virologic suppression. Unfortunately, patient engagement and retention in traditional alcohol treatment services is poor. Screening, brief alcohol intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) has been shown to be effective in reducing hazardous alcohol use and improving health- related outcomes in primary care and emergency room settings. In addition to SBIRT, there are several FDA-approved pharmacotherapies with demonstrated efficacy in reducing alcohol consumption. Providing intervention at the point-of-care through SBIRT in HIV clinics offers an excellent opportunity for integration of brief alcohol intervention and alcohol pharmacotherapy. Utilizing the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), a national network comprised of 8 clinical cohorts and over 20,000 HIV-infected individuals across the US, we will examine the effectiveness of a computer-delivered brief intervention as well as a an HIV provider pharmacotherapy training to prescribe alcohol treatment medications delivered in the HIV clinical care setting. All CNICS patients will be screened for hazardous or binge drinking and individuals with positive screens will be administered the computerized brief intervention (CBI) at their first visit. At the second visit (approximately 3 months later), participants who continue to screen positive will receive either another session of CBI or will be offered CBI and alcohol pharmacotheray (CBl+APT). All participants will be followed for an additional 6 months to determine alcohol reduction and HIV-related outcomes. It is expected that CBl+APT will be more effective than CBI alone, while CBI alone will be more effective than standard of care for reducing hazardous drinking and improving HIV-related outcomes. Further, we will examine patient-related predictors of engagement and retention in care and determine barriers to successful integration of these interventions in the HIV clinical care setting. Finally, cost- effectiveness analyses will be conducted to determine the impact of these interventions in this setting.       "
5 U01 AA021997-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application responds to RFA-AA-12-009, Interventions to Improve HIV/AIDS and Alcohol-Related Outcomes (U01). The proposed study takes place in a HIV primary care clinic and uses the health plan's electronic medical record (EMR) for screening; it has the potential to provide a significant benefit to HIV- infected individuals by reducing hazardous drinking and the associated complications. Prior studies have identified high rates of co-occurrence of HIV and hazardous drinking (defined as drinking over threshold limits, i.e., 5+ daily or 14+ weekly drinks for men and 4+ daily or 7+ weekly drinks for women). Drinking at these levels can compromise antiretroviral (ART) treatment and increase rates of depression, unsafe sex, and mortality. The proposed randomized trial examines the comparative effectiveness of two highly implementable behavioral interventions for reducing hazardous drinking, each with an adaptive, stepped-care component: 1) Motivational Interviewing (MI), consisting of one in-person session with a study clinician and two phone sessions, with three additional phone sessions for those who report hazardous drinking at 6 months; and 2) interactive Emailed Feedback (EF) on hazardous drinking risks using a secure messaging system integrated into the Electronic Medical Record (EMR), with additional emailed feedback for those who report hazardous drinking at 6 months. A third arm will be usual care. We will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the two interventions which have the potential for wide adoption in other similar healthcare settings. The two proposed interventions, MI and EF, are promising approaches for reducing hazardous drinking in the setting of behavioral health and/or primary care. EF also uses secure messaging, an emerging technology that has been tested in other health, behavior change and mental health treatment settings, for problems including alcohol use but not among HIV-infected individuals. In this trial, 600 patients (200 in each arm) will be recruited from Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) San Francisco. The study population and clinic are ideal to examine such interventions since NIAAA-based screening questions are recorded in the EMR, and comprehensive data are available on health care utilization, ART adherence, and HIV clinical outcomes, including the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) index, a recently validated prognostic index based on routine clinical laboratory measures. The research team is well-qualified with complementary expertise in clinical psychology, drug and alcohol abuse treatment, HIV epidemiology, and biostatistics. Thus, the team and study setting provide the ideal environment to test MI and EF, two innovative approaches for reducing hazardous alcohol use in this population, and may provide powerful, generalizable tools for assisting individuals with HIV infection.

The empathetic, committed staff, most of whom have been with the study for more than 15 years (and some for 25 years), has been cited by participants as a key to their continued commitment to the UCLA MACS. State-of-the-art laboratory procedures have been implemented, and quality assurance procedures put in place.  The Center has recruited an outstanding group of UCLA investigators to participate in the MACS, and to assume leadership roles in various scientific areas, taking leadership for 52 research publications since 2003 and contributing to 60 other MACS scientific papers.   The objectives of the UCLA MACS Clinical Center are to:   1) Maintain the cohorts of men recruited in 1984-5 and the men more recently recruited in 2002-3   (primarily Hispanic-Americans and African-Americans);   2) Collect specific behavioral, clinical and psychosocial data, and laboratory specimens from the men;   3) Process laboratory specimens for the local and national specimen repositories of serum, plasma, and cells and to perform flow cytometry and serologic measurements on these samples from Los Angeles participants;   4) Maintain the local repository for use by local investigators;   5) Contribute to ongoing and future studies of cardiovascular complications, renal function, liver diseases, neurocognitive impairment, malignancies, aging, and genomic characteristics of MACS participants;   6) Contribute scientific leadership to the MACS through leadership of several MACS working groups (Core Laboratory, Malignancies/Pathology, Neuropsychology), organization of quality control procedures, leadership in key MACS papers and participation in others, and active participation in the bi-monthly conference calls and meetings of the MACS;   7) Recruit both experienced and new investigators who bring new scientific insights and skills that will enhance the quality and breadth of science in the MACS.   RELEVANCE:    The MACS incorporates a large database of information and biologic specimens collected every six months from 6,972 men followed since 1985-5 (primarily European-American) and 2002-3 (primarily    Latino and African-American), and allows continuing observation of the 3243 survivors.  Thus, the MACS provides an irreplaceable resource for continued study of the natural history of treated and untreated HIV infection and AIDS.         "
5 U01 AI069911-08,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The three countries within the East African leDEA Regional Consortium (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania) have adult HIV prevalence rates ranging between 5-10%.Since the advent of the global antiretroviral therapy (ART) rollout in 2003, there has been a dramatic increase in the percent coverage of those estimated in need of ART (based on the 2006 WHO guidelines), from essentially no patients on in 2003, to 65% coverage in Kenya, 53% in Uganda, and 44% in Tanzania by the end of 2009. Though this dramatic scale-up of HIV treatment has had a positive impact on mortality rates, key questions remain throughout the course of a patient's engagement in care, from the pre- ART period through ART-initiation, initial clinical response to ART and regimen durability (occurrence of adverse events and drug resistance), to long-term maintenance, loss to follow-up (LTFU), and death. It is the long-range goal of this consortium is to provide answers to the questions that clinicians, programs, and ministries of health consider fundamental to the evolution and sustainability of their long term HIV care and treatment strategies. In the next funding cycle, we will address these questions by enhancing data collection in key areas as well as merging existing data sources to better assess and inform the ART rollout in East Africa. We are optimally placed to lead this endeavor as our consortium includes representative HIV-clinics, a harmonized regional database, as well as physicians, epidemiologists, and analysts with expertise in implementation research and a solid understanding of the strengths and limitations of existing data sources. Our top priorities for the next phase of the EA-leDEA Consortium are to: Aim 1: Determine the short and long-term outcomes of adults and children along the entire spectrum of HIV care and examine patient and site-level factors associated with these outcomes; Aim 2: Assess the penetrance and outcomes of prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (pMTCT) strategies; Aim 3: Monitor the translation of evidence into practice for managing co-infections with an emphasis on Tuberculosis (TB); Aim 4: Determine the prevalence, incidence, determinants and outcomes of malignancies in East Africa with a focus on Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and cervical cancer.       RELEVANCE:    Through these efforts, we will enhance our understanding about the HIV-epidemic in its sub- Saharan Africa context, provide insights on the optimal structure and impact of care and treatment programs, expand the set of tools available to inform implementation and operations research in resource-constrained settings and inform policy among stakeholders and decision makers at every level in the region as well as the broader HIV/AIDS scientific community.

5 U24 AA022000-02,"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to RFA-AA-12-010, this U24 application proposes to form a Sexual Minority Populations Resource Core (""SMP Core"") within the Brown University Alcohol Research Center on HIV (ARCH; P01AA019072, Monti, PI). The central themes of the Brown University ARCH are (i) to conduct state-of-the art, integrative, and multidisciplinary research on alcohol-HIV interactions through basic, intervention, and translational science; (ii) to serve as a local, regional, and national resource for alcohol-HIV research and dissemination. The overarching objective of the SMP Core is to extend and enhance the Brown University ARCH by conducting theory-driven analyses and supporting investigations on the co-occurrence of HIV risk and alcohol, and other health challenges, among sexual minority populations in the United States. The SMP Core will place special emphasis on analysis and investigations of health disparities in HIV risk and alcohol among racial/ethnic subgroups of MSM and other sexual minority populations, with a focus on disparities among African American and Hispanic MSM. This will be achieved through three specific aims: (i) compiling and performing theory-based secondary analysis of existing large survey datasets that include measures of HIV, alcohol, and co-occurring challenges in MSM and other sexual minority populations; (ii) synthesizing and critically appraising the state of prevention and intervention science research related to HIV, alcohol, and co-occurring challenges in these populations; (iii) developing collaborations with scientists at Brown University, other affiliated institutions, and with community groups in order to disseminate research and translate findings into new initiatives addressing HIV and alcohol in MSM and other sexually minority populations. These activities will advance the goals of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, NIAAA, as well as the Office of National AIDS Policy and the Institute of Medicine toward strengthening research and intervention in the populations most severely affected by HIV, alcohol, and related health challenges.

5 U2R TW006900-10,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the training program is to conduct training, research and mentorship as well as operationalize research findings in order to strengthen the national capacity to address the public health and scientific challenges of the evolving HIV and TB epidemic in Uganda. This goal will be achieved through collaboration between Joint Clinical Research Centre, Makerere, Gulu and Mbarara Universities of Uganda, Uganda National TB and Leprosy Program, Uganda Ministry of Health, Case Western Reserve University USA and University of Georgia USA. The specific training objectives of this proposal are to strengthen the research training capacity and infrastructure for clinical, operational, and health services research on HIV/TB infections through training, mentorship and strengthen collaboration between HIV and TB control programs as well as collaboration between these programs and academic/research institutions with the view of promoting HIV/TB co-infection prevention, care and treatment. To achieve objectives, we propose inter-disciplinary training in post-graduate degree (long term) and non- degree courses (short-term and intermediate term) courses in Uganda as well as in US institutions. The long term degree raining will be in specialties relevant to HIV/TB prevention and management (such as epidemiology, health services research, public health and clinical specialties). The short-term and medium- term courses will include health informatics, bioethics, operations research, clinical trials, and dissemination and implementation research. Though we will continue with the mix of training experiences in Uganda and US, we propose to have more training at Masters degree in Uganda. This will create a greater demand for mentors for the trainees, so we propose to have training in mentorship for senior researchers who will become mentors of the trainees. The mentors' manual that was developed in the first five years of COHRE phase II will be mad widely available to potential mentors and mentees."
5 U2R TW008254-05,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tanzania is one of the most affected countries in sub-Saharan Africa by HIV/AIDS and TB. We propose to train future leaders to conduct research in epidemiological, operations and health services, and clinical research of HIV/AIDS and TB in Tanzania. Based on an in-depth needs assessment we identified training gaps in three principle areas: (1) research methods including quantitative, qualitative, and cost-effectiveness research methods; (2) substantive knowledge of prevention, care and treatment of HIV/AID S and TB; and (3) Research Systems Strengthening that include training on bioethics, grant writing, and manuscript development. This training initiative will be undertaken by Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences and Harvard School of Public Health, in partnership with the National Institute of Medical Research, Ifakara Health Institute, the Ministry of Health, and the Tanzania Commission for AIDS. Over more than a decade, we have developed a multidisciplinary team of investigators that advanced research training related to discovery of knowledge including the safety and efficacy of various interventions. Over the next 5 years we propose to focus on building capacity in the area of clinical, operational, and health systems research that would advance the implementation of evidence-based best practices on HIV/AIDS and TB. Training will be provided in Boston and Dar es Salaam, with the latter assuming greater proportion of the training activities over the five years of the program. Trainees will benefit from exposure to a broad range of existing collaborative projects between the proposed partners including epidemiological and laboratory studies, randomized clinical trials, operations research programs, and existing datasets. These resources will provide unique opportunities for research training, including practical aspects of study design and implementation and refinement of skills in data analysis and manuscript development. We will regularly monitor our performance and strive to develop a system for sustainable training activities in Tanzania."
